MSTRKRFT (pronounced “masterkraft”) is the Daft Punk-loving alter ego of Death from Above 1979’s Jesse F. Keeler along with producer Al-P. Hailing from Toronto, the duo makes a move from DFA1979’s abrasive rock to robotic electronic complete with vocoders and handclaps. In addition to releasing two singles (“Easy Love” and “Work on You”) and an LP in July 2006 on Last Gang Records,MSTRKRFT have remixed several buzz bands such as Metric, Wolfmother, the Kills, and Bloc Party. As their profile grew (and their album was re-released by Modular) they also began remixing bigger names like Kylie Minogue, Usher and John Legend as well as poppier artists like Annie and Jesse McCartney. For their second album, 2009’s Fist of God, the duo jumped to Dim Mak/Downtown and scored guest appearances from Ghostface Killah, N.O.R.E., John Legend, and E-40.
