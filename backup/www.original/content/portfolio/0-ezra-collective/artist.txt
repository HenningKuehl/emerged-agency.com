Ezra Collective’s incredible musicianship and spirited approach to music - which draws on afrobeat, Latin, hip-hop, grime and more - has seen them break out beyond the thriving UK jazz scene.  
The five friends have already completed a mosh pit-filled and totally sold out UK tour, played at Quincy Jones’ birthday party, and recently toured America for the first time.
