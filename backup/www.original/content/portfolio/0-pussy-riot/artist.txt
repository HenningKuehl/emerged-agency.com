Pussy Riot is a feminist art music collective lead by Nadya Tolokonnikova. Pussy Riot is known for its radiant live music performances that they keep doing since 2011 despite all the dangers coming from the harsh Putin’s regime.
In 2012 three members of Pussy Riot were arrested for performing a queer punk-prayer “Virgin Mary, please get rid of Putin” and convicted for two years in labor camps.
Since their release at the end of 2013 Pussy Riot toured around the world and performed at major festivals such as Glastonbury, Roskilde, Sziget, Riot Fest, Rock al Parque, Banksy’s Dismaland, Nova Rock, the festival of Dangerous Ideas at The Sydney Opera House. Pussy Riot served as grand marshals of Toronto gay pride and performed at pride events in Los Angeles, New York, Vienna, Stockholm, Boston etc.
Pussy Riot performance on stage is an audio-visual live act touching topics of gender fluidity, feminism, LGBTQ+ rights and politics of self.
