Dino d’Santiago grew up in a musical home in the south of Portugal, and his Cape
Verdean parents were part of a local church music choir. It was in this choir that Dino
and his two other siblings started singing every Sunday until he left home, to be part of a
talent show on television and pursue a career as a singer/songwriter. After relocating to
Lisbon, his experience in the choir made him the go-to vocalist for a generation of hip
hop and r&b music acts in Portugal, until, in 2010 he followed his father on a journey
back to their family roots in the Santiago island, where he finally got to change his music
trajectory and connect with the soul of Cape Verdean music, showcased on his album
“Eva” (Lusafrica, 2013). Since then, Dino d’Santiago has been devoting his talent to
bridging together the traditional Morna, Batuku, and Funaná with contemporary R&B
and Global Club
