Quentin DUPIEUX was born in 1974.
At the age of 12, he found a camera and shot anything and everything. At 17, he began to play music to illustrate his images, and bought his first synthesizer.

In 1997 he released his first long-player, on FCOM and invented the silly pseudo: MR OIZO.

In 1999, the brand Levi’s asked him to make 6 ads with a character he had just created : FLAT ERIC. The track he composed for these commercials (FLAT BEAT) reached the top of the charts in Europe on the day of release.

At the same moment he recorded ANALOG WORMS ATTACK, an experimental album. This record scared away most of FLAT BEAT’s fans, but seduced another, more spécialist audience.

Following that, he searched for a way to spend his money and decidesd to produce NONFILM (2001), an incongruous average length movie in which Sébastien Tellier also plays.
Satisfied with this, Quentin decided to not release the movie and put it away after few projections in Paris.

The next 3 years are spent doing nothing.

In 2004, he discovered the joy of computers and totally changed his style of producing music with the recording of his second album, MOUSTACHE (Half a scissor).

In 2006, he met the ed banger crew and starts producing with DJ FEADZ some beats for the young UFFIE, an ingenue female rapper.
He writes and produces « STEAK », his first feature-length film in which he makes his friends act (SebastiAn, Kavinsky, Eric &amp; Ramzi), and composes with Sebastien Tellier and SebastiAn the soundtrack of the film and makes it into an album

He released, in 2007 his first 12 inch for Ed Banger, the famous TRANSEXUAL, and produced a collection of remixes for different artists (Calvin Harris, Scissor Sisters, Cassius, Jamelia.. ).

Then in 2008 he works on a new album (LAMBS ANGER), on UFFIE’s ALBUM and prepares a new feature-length film (REALITE) that he plans to shoot in 2009.

In March of 2009 Mr. Oizo released the Pourriture EP, featuring a remix of Erreur Jean  by Arveene and Misk as well as some "radical reworks" by Oizo himself. A remix of the track "Z" was released as a Beatport exclusive. Also included in the download was a short film by Oizo, titled "Making Lamb's Anger". 
In 2010, Quentin Dupieux directed the movie Rubber, which main character is a serial killer rubber and created its’ soundtrack with Gaspard Augé from the duo Justice.
In November of 2011, Mr. Oizo followed up Lambs Anger with Stade 2, a new release for Ed Banger Records. Slowly releasing the album through club nights and Twitter, Stade 2 further refines the style that he displayed on Lambs Anger, providing tracks for headphones and the dance floor. 
In January 2012 he started a music project with Boys Noize called Handbraekes. 
In April 2012 Mr. Oizo released an EP called Stade 3, which is available for free on the Internet. He also directed the Stade 3 Teaser where Flat Eric is starring again. 

In January 2015, his fith album The Church recorded in Los Angeles was released. 
In his last LP released last year, third for legendary Parisian label Ed Banger Records and Because Music, Mr Oizo has invited friends to collaborate, ranging from Skrillex to punk-electro pop star and performance artist Peaches, pop hook genius Charli XCX plus established electro masters Boys Noize and Siriusmo to name but a few. This isn’t a features album per se, it’s wall to wall Oizo production with a few curveballs thrown in.

He dies in 2041, used by all this superficial bullshit.
