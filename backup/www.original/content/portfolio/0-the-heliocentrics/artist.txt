The UK’s cosmic, psychedelic-funk ensemble issue their second album on maverick
producer Madlib’s label, Madlib Invazion.
The Heliocentrics’ albums are all confounding pieces of work. Drawing equally from
the funk universe of James Brown, the disorienting asymmetry of Sun Ra, the
cinematic scope of Ennio Morricone, the sublime fusion of David Axelrod, Pierre
Henry’s turned-on musique concrète, and Can’s beat-heavy Krautrock, they have –
regardless of the label on which they’ve released their music – pointed the way
towards a brand new kind of psychedelia, one that could only come from a band of
accomplished musicians who were also obsessive music fans. Drummer Malcolm
Catto and bassist Jake Ferguson are the Heliocentrics’ masterminds and producers,
and they are obsessive weirdos in today’s musical climate, searching, progressive
humans who are often out-of-time with current trends.
They have been playing together for nearly two decades and their collective drive is
to find an individual voice. The Heliocentrics search for it in an alternate galaxy
where the orbits of funk, jazz, psychedelic, electronic, avant-garde and “ethnic”
music all revolve around “The One.” With Madilb’s label Madlib Invazion
for Telemetric Sounds, the Heliocentrics have returned to develop their epic vision of
psychedelic funk, while exploring the possibilities created by their myriad influences
– Latin, African, and more.
