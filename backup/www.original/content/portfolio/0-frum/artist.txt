The project FRUM is primarily music, film and expression through the body. The person behind the project, Jenný Augustudóttir Kragesteen, grew up in the Faroe Islands, a group of relatively secluded Islands in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, where old traditions and modern life blend naturally. Growing up so close to breaking waves and green mountains have shaped her, and she wants to bring these blends and impressions into her project.

Although FRUM only released her first song in late-2016, the project has already attracted massive international interest resulting in a tour in China, prominent bookings at showcase festivals across Europe such as Reeperbahn (DE), SPOT (DK) and Nouvelle Prague (BZ), and support from big media such as RBB RadioEins. 

Her first 4 singles and music videos have moreover generated impressive results with more than 500.000 plays on Spotify, being playlisted on the worldwide H&M instore playlist and attracting several sync agency requests for representation vis-à-vis placement on movies, Netflix shows and games.

FRUM got nominated for Reeperbahn Festival’s renowned ANCHOR Award 2018, which goes out to the best upcoming artists performing at the festival. 
Responsible for the nomination are industry professionals such as Camille Hackney (Atlantic/Warner), Christoph Dallach (Die Zeit et.al.) and Rob Challice (Coda Agency) - all part of the ANCHOR board. 
Bowie-producer Tony Visconti, 4 Non Blondes' Linda Perry and KCRW music director Jason Bentley are, amongst others, part of the jury deciding the winner in September.
Currently, FRUM is finishing her debut album which is expected to be released in 2019. In short, she is only just getting started.
