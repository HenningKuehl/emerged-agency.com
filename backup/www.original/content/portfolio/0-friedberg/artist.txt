Friedberg’s debut EP’s duality of upbeat, dance-inducing songs and emotionally heavy lyrics on topics of fear, insecurity and the breakdown of a codependent relationship, feel like an all-night party that ends up with new friends on the roof in fuzzy conversation, content in life’s mysteries. Since releasing the magnetic ‘Pass Me On’ last year, a tune inspired by a drama- lled relationship Anna had and an ode to moving on and moving up, the band have truly made their mark on the scene. Dropping the buzzy track ‘Lizzy’ soon after, this single showcased the band’s blend of post punk, alt-rock doused in alluring pop sensibilities. Charged with frenetic immediacy, energised by synth and insistent drums and Anna’s distinctive vocals, ‘Midi 8’ is the single on the EP that proves the band is willing to push their sound into exciting new realms.
  
Born out of a vision to create a totally new sound, London-based, Austrian-born Anna Friedberg (writer, vocals, cowbell, guitar, and more cowbell) and backed by a stellar cast of musicians, Emily Linden (guitar, vocals), Cheryl Pinero (bass, vocals) and Laura Williams (drums), they are developing exactly that. Music that is both immediately familiar but also like nothing you’ve ever heard before. Friedberg, when literally translated, means "peaceful mountain", but this is far from the frenetic and booming sound of Anna’s colossal new project. Friedberg  rst released music under this new incarnation in 2019 with the successive release of two stand-out singles, catching the imaginations and attention of everyone and anyone who heard them. The last year has seen Friedberg grow together, experimenting with all the di erent skills and talents available to them, re ning their distinctive sound and honing their already highly praised live show. With European headline shows and festival slots already under their belts (Reeperbahn, Eurosonic, BBC Introducing etc), Friedberg have already earned a reputation as one of the most exciting new bands around right now. Simultaneously, they’ve been receiving very impressive amounts of support on the radio across Europe including over 6,000 plays (and a number of playlist additions) including Radio 1, 6 Music, Radio X in the UK while amassing over 6.5 million streams to date.

Friedberg’s debut EP is available now along with a pre-order of the transparent 12" vinyl of ‘YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH’.
