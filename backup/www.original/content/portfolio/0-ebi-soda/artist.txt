Sola Terra’s debut record is a journey into sound, with Brighton based septet Ebi Soda. Drawing inspiration from jazz originators and combining their own coastal flavour and creativity creates a fresh energetic style.

The tracks ebb and flow over a foundation of rhythm, slipping into smooth guitar riffs, swelling trombone and drum sections. Ebi Soda create a big band feel, spilling tight grooves and innovative brass lines through their live shows and recordings.
With a cynical, somewhat industrial approach to jazz which could only be informed by the greyness of the streets of Britain, Ebi juxtapose the skies of their surroundings with an illustrious approach to crafting sound over their abrasive beats, conveying colour and dreariness simultaneously. As staunch anti-traditionalists, they thrive on this idea of contradiction, seeming more inspired by the atmosphere inside a rave than the sounds heard inside Birdland. Their only debt to typical jazz being to attempt to innovate and experiment at every opportunity.

Created through following a particular feeling among the crew, each Ebi track is a sign of the times and contains the essence of their state of mind when recorded. Jazz has long been trademarked by its pre-conceived misconceptions about the typical listener, but within the past few years these boundaries have been crushed thanks to bands such as Ebi Soda. Their dynamic range and broad appeal are bringing the genre back to life, a modern day jazz renaissance.
