It’s been exciting early days for Brighton based experimental group Vels Trio (keys player Jack Stephenson Oliver, bassist Cameron Dawson and drummer Dougal Taylor) since meeting in 2014. 
Despite choosing to sidestep a release of their endeavours over these early years – it’d be somewhat unsurprising if you were to know them already in name. The bands drive to perform and consistently push their live prowess – already garnering an exceptionally diverse array of fans and admirers alike – has propelled them into the live arena to share stages with acts such as Cory Henry and the Funk Apostles, Sons of Kemet, Moses Boyd’s Exodus, Let Spin and two performances at the illustrious Love Supreme Festival. 
Being almost indistinguishable by any sole genre, the group’s mutual loves and individual fortes across prog, electronic, jazz, funk and hip-hop has paved the collective way for their early sound. 
With a keen desire in improvisation, Vels Trio’s sound can be characterised by their heavy grooves, emotionally charged songwriting, coupled alongside expressive, progressive modern musicianship to create an excitingly frenetic, and irresistibly engaging live sound structures. 
After 3 years of tirelessly indulging in their passion for music in an endeavour to explore, discover and create – Vels Trio are ready to unveil their inaugural release Yellow Ochre EP – a small collage of their friendships, high times and experiences as a band so far.
