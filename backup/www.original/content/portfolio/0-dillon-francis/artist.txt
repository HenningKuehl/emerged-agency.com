Platinum selling artist, DJ, producer, and all-around nice guy Dillon Francis has continued to surprise fans worldwide. His catalog encompasses the #1 Dance Radio Airplay hit "Anywhere" [feat. Will Heard], "Candy" [feat. Snappy Jit], #1 Billboard Dance Club Songs chart topper "Coming Over" with Kygo [feat. James Hersey], and the RIAA platinum certified "Get Low" with DJ Snake which surpassed 500 million worldwide streams. He initially landed in the history books during 2012 as "the first moombahton artist to achieve the number one spot on Beatport" on the Something, Something Awesome EP. His 2014 major label debut, Money Sucks, Friends Rule [Mad Decent/Columbia Records], graced Rolling Stone's "Top Electronic Albums of 2014" list as 2015's This Mixtape Is Fire EP bowed at #1 on Billboard's Top Dance/Electronic Albums Chart.

Dillon Francis has had a monumental 2018 surrounding the release of his second album, 'WUT WUT,' which featured multiple releases leading up to the album alongside some of the biggest names in Latin music including De La Ghetto, Arcangel, Fuego, Residente and many more. Francis has opened up a lane for himself in another global market reaching a predominantly Spanish-speaking and/or bilingual audience that has long embraced dance music. Francis' latest commercial release "White Boi" (feat. Lao Ra) was met with much excitement, immediately debuting in the Top 40 at Mexico's Spanish Pop radio upon its release. This year has also brought Francis numerous career milestones, including nominations for both a Latin American Music Award and Latin GRAMMY Award respectively for his collaboration with Puerto Rican superstar, Residente on their song, "Sexo."

As he wraps up his third consecutive year of his residency at the Wynn Las Vegas, Francis' 2018 tour schedule included some of the biggest festival stages around the world including EDC (Mexico & Orlando), Lollapalooza (Chile, Brazil, Paris, Chicago), Festival Estereo Picnic (Bogota, Colombia), Ultra, TomorrowWorld and Electric Zoo.

In addition to his music, Dillon Francis also recently released a 7-episode comedy series 'Like and Subscribe' available exclusively on Funny or Die and Amazon Video. The show follows Skyy Goldwynne (Dillon Francis), Hollywood's biggest manager who locks 4 of his influencer clients in a house with a camera crew. "'Like & Subscribe' Is Here & It's Hilarious"- Billboard.

Francis consistently engages a social media following of over 2 million on Instagram, 1.5 million on Facebook, and over 1 million on Twitter with a string of hilarious content. Moreover, his music has lit up Furious 7, Entourage, Neighbors, Zoolander 2, and more.
