Brian Jackson is a legendary composer, pianist and flautist. Jackson wrote, arranged and produced over 10 albums over an eight-year period. His music has found its way onto over 100 cuts like Common's “The People” (from "We Almost Lost Detroit") and Kendrick Lamar's “Poe Mans Dreams” (from "Peace Go With You, Brother"). Brian looks to both the present and the past for inspiration in order to honor to the ancient tradition of the griot - the African troubadour of truth.
