Sho Madjozi is one of the most exciting acts to come out of South Africa in recent years. 
A rising star from rural Limpopo who shot to fame after featuring in the hit track Gqi by OkmalumkoolKat in 2017, she has since released tracks with Dj Maphorisa, Wanlov, Ms Cosmo and others. 
Her single Dumi hi Phone with PS DJz went viral, gaining her a growing following from all over the country. 
The song has sat at the number 1 spot on several local radio stations and is starting to enjoy some play abroad.
While she calls herself a rapper, Sho Madjozi is most often flexing her flows on Gqom and Shangaan electro.

Famous for bringing Xitsonga (Shangaan) to the mainstream and for her exhilarating performances in which she wears a traditional skirt called Xibelani, Sho Madjozi has played the biggest shows in South Africa since she came out last year including Black Coffee Block Party, Rocking the Daisies, Trace Festival, FillupFNBStadium and Afropunk Johannesburg. 
She has been booked for her first American show at Afropunk Brooklyn in August 2018.
In late 2017, Absolut Vodka SA spotted the young star and made her one of their new Creative Revolutionaries.

Her explosive rise has left many wondering how she has made traditional culture so cool. 
She settled it well in a TV interview where when asked how she can embrace her culture and still be that cool she responds, "I don’t think the question is how can I still be cool while rocking my culture, there is nothing cooler than being African right now" and her whole movement proves it.
