****     
Evangelical peddlers of DNA-rearranging post-punk exotica, Melt Yourself Down are an unholy communion of North African influences and shamanic vocals with a wanton disregard for their own safety.

Formed by saxophonist Pete Wareham, they number in their ranks some of the finest musicians of their generation, with members having played with Acoustic Ladyland, Polar Bear, Sons Of Kemet, The Comet Is Coming, Hello Skinny, Zun Zun Egui and Mulatu Astatke.
