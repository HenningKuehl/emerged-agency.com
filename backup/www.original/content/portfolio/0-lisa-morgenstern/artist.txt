Lisa Morgenstern is a German / Bulgarian pianist, singer and composer based in Berlin. The daughter of two orchestral musicians, Morgenstern was exposed to music from a very young age and displayed a natural affinity towards the piano. She also trained while a teenager as a professional ballet dancer, something that’s lent her music a unique elegance and poise.

Tracing melodies of spine-tingling grace and wonder, she sings of desperation and deliverance, loss and salvation. Even more striking are her capabilities as a performer, composer and arranger. Her Album CHAMELEON (2019) was born of a challenge to create an album using only voice, piano and synths, and it comes as a shock to realize that its rhythms are merely implied, rather than performed on drums or programmed electronically. Recorded in collaboration with Berlin based, Argentinian producer and cellist Sebastian Plano, Chameleon combines glacial elegance (‘Atlas’), baroque synth-pop (‘My Boat’), poignantly atmospheric electronica (‚Levitation’), expressive piano instrumentals (‚Codex’), and showcases in its entirety extraordinary dexterity and grand romance.

Over the past two years her flourishing reputation has led to performances across Europe with artists including Ólafur Arnalds and Max Cooper, as well as at festivals from Iceland Airwaves at the National Theatre Reykjavik to the Reeperbahn Festival at the Elbphilharmonie Hamburg. Her collaborations with the renowned women's choir Bulgarian Voices Berlin and later with the Munich Radio Orchestra have left a particularly strong impression. Most recently she was confirmed for Roskilde Festival 2020.
Wherever she’s played, though, MORGENSTERN has won over her audience with her emotional performance style. It may be her remarkable, multi-octave spanning voice that gets you first, but her songs – and their live execution, Morgenstern’s arms often stretched either side of her as she simultaneously plays multiple instruments while singing – are irresistibly, intensely compelling too. There really is nothing quite like her.
