Monumental Men produce electronic music with the intensity of movies. A captivating mélange where determination and caution, force and tenderness, fanfares and soul and analog and digital meet. 

Fanfares herald the coming of something big, something epic. Maybe there is a whole army waiting behind that hill. Maybe a hurricane. Clouds pass overhead as if they were migrant birds on their way to winter’s nest. This might as well be the opening sequence of a new cult series. Something in between «Game of Thrones» and «Twin Peaks» perhaps. Certainly mystical and mighty, but also very close to nature. 

The music of Monumental Men generates images, evoking atmospheres and worlds normally reserved for the big screen of a movie theatre. Weighty, rock-like beats and sounds are contrasted by delicate and distorted vocals, merging into experimental pop music. At the same time confident and seeking, electronic and analog, organic and completely artificial. Monumental sounds, at first glance set in stone only to vanish the very next moment. 

This mystical-melancholic œuvre is the work of producers Biru and Melvyn Buss, Dancefloor veterans with Round Table Knights and Mercury, as well as vocalist Roman Bühlmann, lead singer of Folk outfit Patrick Bishop. Building on an experimental groundwork of edits and club tracks, the new-found trio sets out to capture the exciting dynamics of clubmusic and to translate it into contemporary pop. To play with arrangement and effect without ever fully exhausting the possibilities. Thus, listeners are regularly captivated by extraordinary twists, gloomily glimpsing into an abyss before suddenly finding themselves on top of a Himalayan peak. Or following the elusive and shifting vocals, in search of love, security and a sense of home. 
The music of Monumental Men does not have to rely on overexposure to establish crystal- clear atmospheres. It opts for a timbre and lets it sink in – such skillful craft you’re immediately hooked.
