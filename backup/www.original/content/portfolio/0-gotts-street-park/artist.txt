The Leeds-based trio, comprised of producer/writers Josh Crocker (bass, production), Tom Henry (keys) and Joe Harris (guitar), met through Leeds flourishing live music circuit, playing in and around local bands and venues.

Individually, they have produced and written for the likes of Kali Uchis, Yellow Days, Celeste and Mabel. Combining on their shared love for “The idea of doing things live in one room”, the creation and recording of a song – a group of players walking into a room with nothing, and exiting with something life-altering – still, after 70-odd years of pop music, retains unrivalled magic.

The approach is a deliberate callback to the methods made famous by legendary studios like Sun and Stax in Memphis, or FAME and Muscle Shoals in Alabama, and their in-house bands.

Combined also with a shared love of movie soundtracks and film scores, Gotts Street Park are taking these ideas and techniques forward. Giving them a modern feel and texture, whilst collaborating with some of the most exciting new vocalists out there.
