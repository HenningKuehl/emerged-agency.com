Born from the depths of darkness, 24-year-old artist RL Grime creates sonic worlds that are arcane and mysterious in nature, yet resonate far beyond the dancefloor. With works that pay as much attention to texture and space as they do synth arrangement and drum patterns, RL Grime has carved a lane for himself within the electronic space without losing sight of his artistic foresight; striving for innovative ways to push boundaries rather than cling onto trends.

In the live space, RL Grime is an unparalleled force...crafting DJ sets that weave in and out almost entirely his own productions, reformatting them and presenting them in an entirely new light. His superior mixing technique combined with his always special live production makes for an viscerally captivating spectacle that’s equally energetic as it is daring.

With three EP’s, a full-length album, and countless sold out performances on some of the biggest stages around the world, RL Grime continues to redefine our understanding of what it means to be a 21st century producer in the electronic space.
