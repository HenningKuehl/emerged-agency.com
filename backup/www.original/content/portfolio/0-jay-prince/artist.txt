Jay Prince has received co-signs from the likes of Chance The Rapper and critical acclaim from the likes of Zane Lowe (Beats One) and Annie Mac (BBC Radio 1) for his artistry. His music fuses silky smooth raps that touch on life experiences and opinions on social/cultural issues, with funky, feel good production.

The prolific rapper/producer recently released an EP entitled ‘WONDER’ which continues the momentum of his last EP ‘CHERISH’, which took him into the top 5 in Spotify’s UK Viral Chart with lead track “In The Morning”, which was premiered by Zane Lowe on Beats 1, and
racked up 15 million EP plays on the Spotify alone, contributing to an impressive 55m streams on the platform across his catalogue.

He recently embarked on a sold out 2019 tour which will took him to 11 cities across Europe. No stranger to the road, in 2018 Prince also embarked on his second sold out Asia tour, performed at SXSW with Soundcloud, as well as his 4th consecutive Coachella, this time to 25k+ people on the Sahara stage with Snakehips. Looking back further in his career, Prince was picked by Chance The Rapper to be main support on his last European tour, adding to other stints supporting the likes of Mick Jenkins, Mura Masa and Major Lazer.

The East London boy, who honed his musical ability playing in the band at his local Canning Town church, has been embraced by the world and continues to cross boundaries with his universal appeal. His sound has been described as “honeyed hip-hop, recall- ing the dawn of US sunshine rap” (PRS for Music) and has received widespread support from the likes of The Fader, Hypetrak, XXL, Pigeons & Planes, MTV, Complex, Revolt, Red Bull Music and Noisey.

MTV listed him as an artist on “The Brink” and Hypetrak tipped him as “One To Watch”, whilst XXL shortlisted him for the prestigious Freshmen 2016 alongside the likes of Bryson Tiller and Anderson Paak: one of few British names ever selected.

Prince is currently the face of Soundcloud’s “First On” marketing campaign, billboards for which were placed across New York and London. He is also one of the faces of the recent Reebok UK campaign and you can hear his track “Father, Father” on the soundtrack to the 2019 edition of Konami’s Pro Evolution soccer game.
