If you’ve listened to a widely acclaimed album in the last few years, chances are
you’ve heard John Carroll Kirby’s work. The pianist, producer and composer has
collaborated with artists including Solange, Frank Ocean, Bat for Lashes, Connan
Mockasin, Sébastien Tellier, Harry Styles, and many more. Now, with his new solo
album My Garden (Stone’s Throw), Kirby is set to tell his own stories.
