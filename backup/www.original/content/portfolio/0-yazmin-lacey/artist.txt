Yazmin Lacey sings with the directness and emotional clarity of classic soul. Having written in her bedroom for her whole life, she began to play acoustic shows in 2014. As her reputation grew locally in Nottingham, she came to meet the diverse group of musicians who would form her band.
Together, they’ve written an EP which combines Yazmin’s incisive songwriting with the vitality of jazz. Her sound resonates with lovers of soulful and honest music. ‘Brilliant singer/songwriter and great new name for the UK’ Gilles Peterson July 2017.
