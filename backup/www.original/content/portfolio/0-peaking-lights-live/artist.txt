Californian electronic pop duo Peaking Lights have been making music together since 2008. Their most recent release, ‘Sea of Sand’ came out on Dekmantel in 2018. It’s a kaleidoscopic melting-pot of dainty dub, experimental and leftfield beats, with wondrous sunny soundscapes that blend together the unconventional home-fashioned electronics, and windswept vocals that have defined Peaking Lights to date.

Already with a string of highly acclaimed albums across their ten year production history, the husband and wife duo that is Aaron Coyes and Indra Dunis have carved out a niche of quirky electronic, and psychedelic pop sounds. ‘Sea of Sand’ sees the act once again teaming up with an international label, having released on some of the most integral and pioneering imprints in the scene, including releases on Mexican Summer, Weird World/Domino, Not Not Fun, Night People, and their own label Two Flowers Records. 

The band, who founded themselves on innovative technology, and a pragmatic approach to sound and composition recorded the EP together in their home studio, Dreamfuzz, in Los Angeles. It’s a prelude to a forthcoming LP due in early 2020. With a DIY aesthetic and approach to analogue instrumentalism, Peaking Lights retro-digital sound is one that sits perfectly with Dekmantel. Recently moving to Amsterdam from Los Angeles, the duo is thrilled to expand their presence in Europe, and will be playing live shows and well as Djing throughout Europe in the remainder of 2019 and into 2020.
