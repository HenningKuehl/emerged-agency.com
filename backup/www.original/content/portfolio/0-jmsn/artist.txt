Hailing from Detroit, Michigan - JMSN has emerged on the international stage as one of the music industry’s most sought-after performers and producers.
 
On June 19, 2018 JMSN dropped the second single, "Talk is Cheap", from his new album, Velvet. This sixth studio album from JMSN will be released on his self-founded label, White Room Records.
 
JMSN has built a reputation for himself through his unforgettable live performances and his trademark sounds, garnering nods from R&B/Soul legends, such as Puff Daddy, Usher, and founding member of The Commodores, Thomas McClary. JMSN’s impressive talents have been tapped by the likes of Kendrick Lamar, Game, Mac Miller, J. Cole, Tyga, Ab-Soul, Kaytranada, Ta-ku, and many more.
 
In 2017, JMSN completed tours of North America, Europe, and Asia in support of his album, Whatever Makes U Happy. JMSN plans to support this new album with a string of headline dates across North America and Europe, in addition to previously announced dates supporting Alina Baraz.
