The next big thing. DRAMAS released their second, self-titled album in April 2021, on which the much-acclaimed artpop/electro duo has once again taken a big musical step forward and further refined their already distinctive sound with a large dose of experimentation and verve. With the latest single release and the energetic album opener “Noday” they now underline this impressively.
DRAMAS skillfully master the art of the in-between: between a heavy heart and the knowledge that everything changes, that nothing stands still.

Formed in 2016, DRAMAS immediately presented an emotional debut with their debut album “Nothing Is Permanent” (2018) and landed indie airplay hits with several single releases from it – the song “Mess” was voted to the top of the official listener charts on Radio Eins in Germany.
Subsequently, Viktoria Winter and Mario Wienerroither, who besides inspires millions of people worldwide with his “Musicless Music videos” on Youtube and even became a BBC award winner, also made a name for themselves as an exciting live band. So DRAMAS satisfied at numerous festivals or as top-class tour support for the British shooting star Cosmo Sheldrake.

The fact that DRAMAS can also be counted on internationally in the long term was recently underlined by the duo in the pandemic year and the singles “Undercover Dreamer”, “Bloodbath” and this year’s Indie hit “Candy”, all of which caused a sensation on over 100 radio stations across Europe.
Driven by the fascination of unconscious opposites and contradictions, Viktoria Winter and Mario Wienerroither wrap heavy and oppressive contents into reduced, deeply moving music on their second album.
“What’s so heavy on this mind?”, DRAMAS once asked in the song “Libra” and to this day they consistently celebrate the coexistence of these opposites with their very own musical sound. With apparent ease, Wienerroither blends stylistic ingredients from various genres, cinematic soundscapes, synthesizer, electro, drum and percussion sounds with Winter’s unmistakable voice to create an even greater whole.
