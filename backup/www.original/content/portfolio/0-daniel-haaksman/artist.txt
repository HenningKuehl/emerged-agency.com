“For the music industry,” Daniel Haaksman told Afropop Worldwide, “it’s the worst time ever. But for new music, it’s the best time ever. With the internet, everything is circulating.” As a DJ and producer, and as head honcho of Man Recordings, Berlin-based Daniel is right in the eye of this exciting storm. He recognises no boundaries or borders, rejoicing in the free-flow of creativity as he absorbs all the rhythms and shades of this planet of sound in his own productions. He’s got an especially keen ear when it comes to Africa or Brazil, and is an artist who never neglects the power of a strong melody when it comes to satiating a hungry dancefloor, be it a wiry guitar riff or some tinkling balafon. 

Full-flavoured and 100% proof, a Daniel Haaksman DJ set takes no prisoners, nor leaves a single person unmoved. Daniel first became known to an international audience with the release of his 2004 compilation "Rio Baile Funk Favela Booty Beats" (Essay Recordings), on which he presented the sound of Rios favelas to a worldwide audience for the first time. The internationally acclaimed compilation coined the genre term "Baile Funk", which is now widespread all over the world. 

Under his direction, over one hundred releases were released on his label Man Recordings, founded in 2005, dealing with bass music of the global South and its international adaptations.  As a producer Daniel has released numerous compilations, singles and EPs, the albums "Rambazamba" and "African Fabrics" as well as the remix compilation "Remixes 2007-2017". As a DJ Daniel Haaksman travelled all five continents and played in countless clubs, festivals and events.  In January 2019 Daniel Haaksman releases his third album "With Love, From Berlin". It features numerous collaborations with Berlin-based international artists such as Cibelle, Dengue Dengue Dengue, Robert Owens, Tikiman and others.
