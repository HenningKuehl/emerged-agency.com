Faces On TV is the creation of Jasper Maekelberg, a multi-instrumentalist and producer who’s intelligent and adventurous psychedelic pop has caused a stir in his native Belgium.
The celebrated sound-architect released his eagerly-anticipated debut album ‘Night Funeral’ on April 20 2018 Unday Records. A polychromatic symphony of magnetic synths, shuffling rhythms and exotic sounds, echoes of Air, Alt-J and Portishead can be heard across the album, resulting in a multicoloured fusion of sparkling percussion, crafting beats and tempting vocals. Tracks like recent single ‘The Image of Boy Wonder’, conjure up a psychedelic dream-world of bass-heavy trip hop and eerie ambience, backed by epicurean female vocals, resulting in an alluring nugget of poptronica, while new single ‘Dancing After All’, is a rich mix of fizzing electronics that tells a tale of debauchery, twisted love and broken emotions, a familiar theme across the album.
