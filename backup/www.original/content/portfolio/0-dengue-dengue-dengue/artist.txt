Dengue Dengue Dengue is a Tropical Bass duo. Behind the masks are Felipe
Salmon and Rafael Pereira, two producers, dj’s and graphic designers from Lima,
Perú. Their work explores the rhythms from Peru and other parts of the world,
recreating them electronically by mixing new and old, analog and digital, to create a
unique sound and visuals. Their musical explorations go from psychedelic cumbia to
dub, from salsa to footwork, from tribal to techno. Their visual and sound palette
continues to grow and add new flavours to this melting pot.
