Text: 

Wyatt Waddell is known for his complex yet unforgettable melodies and exuberant presence. His powerful and versatile vocal range moves seamlessly between the raspy timbre of James Brown and the melodic whimsy of Paul McCartney. Though his musicality recalls the old greats, Wyatt’s inventive and playful approach is fully his own. a multi-instrumentalist known for his perfect pitch and instinctive songwriting, Wyatt’s talents are on full display on his latest two new singles You & Fight!

Wyatt has been bubbling at the edges of the Chicago underground, and is now set to bring his infectious mix of r&b, pop and funk to the rest of the world.
