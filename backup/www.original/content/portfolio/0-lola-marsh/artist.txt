Lola Marsh, aka vocalist Yael Shoshana Cohen and multi-instrumentalist Gil Landau, create music that combine clever lyrics with deep warm harmonies. 
At the start of 2016, the young duo self-released “You're Mine,” an impressive debut EP that cemented Lola Marsh as collaborators of magnetic, thoughtful indie-pop. Their distinctive sound resulted in a quick rise, first online and then in person, with performances bringing the 5-piece band to Europe and North America. 
They followed with their debut record, “Remember Roses,” in the summer of 2017 - an effervescent collection of songs that boast a stunning juxtaposition of wistfulness and melancholy, set against an eccentrically offbeat pop backdrop. The record was received with critical acclaim, and the singles climbed to the top of Spotify’s most viral charts, hitting over 40 million streams that are growing by the day. 

The band gained attention from NPR, Paste Magazine, NYLON, Observer, Interview Magazine and more. The leading single 'Wishing Girl’ became a fan favorite and was featured in ads for leading brands such as Ebay, California Lottery, and for the french perfume Guerlain.
Their popularity crossed over to Hollywood and they co-wrote a song for the film “Criminal” and were featured in the hit TV series "Better Call Saul", with a cover for Frank & Nancy Sinatra’s “Something Stupid”. the song was nominated and eventually won in the best song category at the Guild of Music Supervisors awards in LA. The song “You’re Mine” was featured in the movie “To all the boys P.S i love you 2”.
Once again their music brought them Stateside, seeing the duo tour nonstop, playing on stages at big-named festivals including Primavera Sound, Pohoda, Exit, Dockville, Pukkelpop, Montreaux, FNAC & intensively touring Europe & the USA.

The band's sophomore album "Someday Tomorrow Maybe", was released in early 2020, and was inspired in part by the evolution of their own relationship as collaborators and, for a time, romantic partners. Lola Marsh, Landau says, is “romantic, nostalgic and a bit dreamy.” The New York Times agrees, having praised the band for “sweeping, cinematic music dripping in retro charm".
following the second album release, the first single “Echoes” won best song in the Berlin Music Video Awards. the band was invited to play at the French tv show “Taratata”.
