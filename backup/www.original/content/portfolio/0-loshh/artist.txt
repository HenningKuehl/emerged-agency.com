Receiving plaudits across the breadth of the media for his debut singles FEELAM and FAJI, the multidisciplinary artist follows up with his much-anticipated 7-track EP full of smoky Latin-tinged, percussion-heavy tracks produced by Santiago Morales set against his powerful vocal delivery. An EP created in its entirety through the month of July 2020, both the artist and producer locked themselves away to create a breathtaking body of work at the producer’s home studio in London during lockdown. Finding himself indoors with no distractions, Loshh was confronted with his deepest darkest thoughts head-on, “I couldn’t run from what was going on in the world nor my mind,” he recalls. “My mind was ticking, I had to take it out and speak my thoughts – March and April were especially manic and it was taking a toll on myself, I had to express,” he recalls. 
 
Citing King Sunny Ade and Fela Kuti as influences, their presence is strongly felt throughout the project as Loshh delivers his message with passion and hope as an artist of integrity. “The EP is about perseverance through everything in today’s world, and the adversity that comes with race, identity and poverty. Migration and displacement can break someone’s spirit if they are not reminded of who they are,” he states. “It’s about finding my footing as a black man within a white supremacist world and how to dismantle it without compromising my own identity.”
 
With roots in poetry, visual art and sound, Loshh is an artist with a clear vision who knows exactly what direction to take. The real beauty is in his performance, on stage with his six-piece band is where he really shines and takes the audience on his journey, as displayed in his 2020 Afropunk show. Growing up in a family with notable connections to the performing arts, he accredits the Juju, Fuji and Gospel sound as his earliest inspirations for his music and expression. Not going unnoticed by the spectrum of the media, Loshh has been rightfully tipped as someone to look out for by Pitchfork, The Guardian, The Face, Highsnobiety and Crack Magazine to name a few. It’s forward momentum only for this polymath.
