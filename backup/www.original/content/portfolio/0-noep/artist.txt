NOËP is an electronic-pop act from Tallinn, who has licensed his singles to Sony Sweden. The Estonian newcomer aka singer-writer-producer Andres Kõpper, has already created quite a buzz around both his home country and on an international scale.

Since releasing his debut track ‘Move’ in 2015, NOËP has caught the attention of music lovers and industry professionals alike, and with the track amassing over 9 million plays on Spotify. His live shows are as attention grabbing and emotive as the recorded music. 

NOËP has been described as “a delicate and infectious blend of stripped back electronica, bringing a weird but wonderful fusion of worlds to the table that speak for an exciting example of blending genres and bringing new energy into the electronic dance space. Sitting somewhere between Beirut and Chromeo, NOËP is an emotively charged musical force of the highest calibre.” – **Dancing Astronaut**

"He's often compared to Woodkid or Dan Smith (Bastille). By adding a synth, launch pad and laptop, his sound takes a different dimension and can capture the crowd's attention quickly.” – **RedBull**

"Everything NOËP touches turns to gold.” - **CLASH**
