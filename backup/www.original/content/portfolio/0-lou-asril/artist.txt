I love it when your body shakes to the beat.

It is said to choose your superlatives wisely. However, leaving them out, describing 20-year-old Soul & RnB Wizkid LOU ASRIL, is close to impossible. Starting a classic piano education at 11, he formed a band at 15 and began performing his songs right around this time. At 17 he won the ‘Joe Zawinul Award’ (after the great late Miles Davis and Weather Report bandleader), landing him spots in several songwriting sessions in Los Angeles.
2019 brought his first public appearance with “Divine Goldmine“, "Soothing Moving” and “Friek” as well as a definite start to his live career, conquering the stages with his groovy, velvety sounds. Lou's songs immediately gained traction among a very diverse audience and on radios, mounting i.e. in two #1 songs on highly influential radio FM4, two nominations for the Amadeus Austrian Music Awards (“Best Alternative”, FM4 Award) and performances at several high profile festivals (like Viennas “Popfest”, “Glatt&Verkehrt” Festival, Eurosonic Noorderslag Festival). 

In March 2020, right when the pandemic hit, his debut EP “louasril” set sail for a new chapter - but the world had different plans, so his sold out release show at "WUK Vienna“ fell victim to the restrictions on live events, communicated the day before. But Lou Asril lives for the stage - so he and his band didn't let the unusual circumstances of this summer stop them from performing live, in adapted form (Glatt & Verkehrt Festival with an exclusive choir ensemble, ORF Radiofestival, poolbar Festival), where they proved that they still reach ears and hearts of their audiences, even from a physical distance. In summer 2020, Lou Asril also released his follow up single “Berlin, Pretty City“, a collaboration with Hamburg based producer AgaJon. For the joint performance at the Austrian Amadeus Music Awards 2020 Lou Asril and (Conchita) WURST released the progressive, electronic cover of the Austrian disco-classic "Lovemachine". This at least shows once again Lou Asril’s enthusiasm for hip hop and electronic music; his universe is far from finished. This is just the beginning.
