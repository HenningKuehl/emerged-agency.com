Singer, pianist, writer, poet and creative being, Allysha Joy, is a key member of Melbourne collective, 30/70. Their growing success over the last two years has led her to further challenge her expression in a project of her own, pushing boundaries as a female keys player, poet, singer and producer. 
Whether performing solo on Fender Rhodes or accompanied by her band, Allysha’s steady groove, husky vocal tone and unique style of writing emanates her own personal truth and illuminates a powerful feminine energy learning to be peaceful, giving and considerate of others.

Allysha grew up listening to jazz, soul, hip hop and RnB. Her sound is dynamic and raw, real and complex. “As a performer I look to people that present their genuine self on stage, reaching for something beyond the present moment, beyond themselves, being a vessel for something greater. I always try to take the audience on a journey”. 
And as a song-writer Allysha draws from her own experiences and the empathy she feels for the world and its inhabitants. “I write as a way to process the emotion that consumes me in day to day life, otherwise I'd explode”.
