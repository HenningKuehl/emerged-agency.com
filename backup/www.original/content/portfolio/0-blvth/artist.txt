First things first: “You pronounce it [blu:t]”, not boulevard, nor bluetooth! But chances are, most people already got that… after all Berlin-based Albanian-Polish prodigy BLVTH has had credits on no less than three (3!) number one records in Germany recently. International collaborations as a writer and producer include bülow, Portugal. The Man, JR Blender (Diplo, Major Lazer) as well as many major German rap acts like KUMMER, Casper and Marteria. And because merely functioning behind the curtains is not nearly enough for a prolific artist like BLVTH, he still manages to put out a continuous flow of original solo material in the form of “Collections”, a combination of songs and merchandise lines.
