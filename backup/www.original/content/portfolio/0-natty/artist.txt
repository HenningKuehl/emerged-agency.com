Following his Top 20 debut album, 'Man Like I', Natty is back with his highly anticipated second album 'Release The Fear', a future-roots, concept album that takes us on a journey through love, redemption, self-identity and unity.

Described by the Telegraph as a "soul-reggae crossover sensation" Natty is an artist who brings the revolutionary spirit of the 60s and 70s into current times. The Sunday Times praised his lyrics as "sharply focused" and his songs as "free from production trickery".
Seven years in the making, 'Release The Fear' reflects Natty's spiritual and sonic progression, bringing forward cosmic and mindful energies through his unmistakable delivery.

The first single of the album, 'I'm Alive', is a catchy proclamation of faith and a declaration of thanks for new times and new energies. It is accompanied by an evocative and visually stimulating animated video.

Other inspiring songs include 'Street lights', a fast paced, high energy beat that dares us to reconnect with each other and the space around us, as well as 'Stand up in Love' which calls for a truly unifying love that transcends conventional boundaries.

Sonically, 'Release The Fear' is genre straddling whilst retaining an authentic, roots / soul / Afrocentric identity, amalgamating into what Natty describes as "futureroots". Recorded live, the album has a unique sound with tracks ranging from the delicate and hypnotic 'Rainclouds' to the militant and arousing 'Change' featuring Busy Signal and Albarosie.

Since parting with his major label, Natty has been hard at work building his own unique brand, independently releasing an award-winning EP, set up his record label Vibes & Pressure and a monthly club night by the same name. Still very active on the live music circuit, the North Londoner has hit the stages of SWSW, Radio 1's Big Weekend, Glastonbury, Secret Garden Party, Reading & Leeds and the BBC Electric Proms.
Natty has also toured the USA supporting Ziggy Marley and travelled to Zimbabwe, Brazil, Japan and Europe performing for local crowds.

Previously receiving the support from the likes of BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, ITV, MTV, 'Later with Jools Holland' amongst others, Natty is excited to embark on his new project and share his message of love with the rest of the world.
