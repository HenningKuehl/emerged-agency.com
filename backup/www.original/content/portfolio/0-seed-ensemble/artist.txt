Formerly know as SEED Ensemble, seed. is a Mercury Award nominated ten-piece band led by alto saxophonist and composer Cassie Kinoshi.

The band presents a stellar line-up featuring some of London’s most up-and-coming young jazz musicians. West African and Caribbean influenced groove, seed. explores a blend of genres through original compositions and improvisation. Their debut release Driftglass (Jazz Re:freshed, 2019) features the track Afronaut (feat. XANA) which won the Ivors Academy Award 2018 (formerly known as BASCA, British Composer Award) for Jazz Composition for Large Ensemble.
