Like his mythological namesake, Daedelus is an inventor, a creator of labyrinthian sound from an eclectic palette into innovative genre with over two-dozen releases on a variety of labels (i.e. Brainfeeder, Ninjatune) and collaborations with musicians in many worlds: electronic, jazz, hip-hop, indie (i.e. Kelela, Kneebody, MF DOOM).

A founding figure of the L.A. “Beat Scene,” often having played the storied Low End Theory Club, Daedelus has performed over a thousand shows for audiences on five continents, everywhere from Iceland to Istanbul.
