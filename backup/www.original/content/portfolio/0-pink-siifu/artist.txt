“One of the most intriguing musicians in Black music.” ~ THE FADER

"Outré" is one way to describe the music of the kaleidoscopic rapper-singer-producer Pink Siifu, but that doesn't quite capture it. His prolific catalogue—takes in hip-hop, soul, free jazz, gospel, and punk, all grounded by a defined sense of Afrocentrism and spirituality." ~ New Yorker

Shifting between styles with deftness, Alabama’s elusive Pink Siifu found underground success in the late 2010s with his experimental blend of genres. Piecing together aspects of his wide-ranging influences, the musician built an extensive catalog during the 2010s, releasing a total of 46 EPs, albums, and mixtapes throughout the decade.

Baltimore-based Pink Siifu and Richmond, VA’s Fly Anakin released their first track ‘Dollar Dr. Dream’ in August, with their full album came out in November 2020 – reflecting the artist’s musical community, through the guise of a fictional record store called ‘Fly Siifu’s’.
