The Trinidad-born multi-instrumentalist relays his experiences of growing up in London through his eye-opening perspectives and chilling performances. Utilising influences from soul, rap and contemporary electronic styles, Berwyn aims to provide the listener with a sensitive insight into an often unwelcoming hyper masculine world.  Berwyn unveils his highly-anticipated debut full-length project in the form of ‘DEMOTAPE/VEGA’. With just a handful of singles and some features on XL Recordings boss Richard Russel’s Everything Is Recorded project prior to this release, Beewyn has quickly cemented himself as one of the most interesting and innovative emcees to come out of the UK in quite a while. Featuring previous cuts ‘TRAP PHONE’ and ‘GLORY’, the ten-track project captures Berwyn’s heartwarming delivery and soothing tones over rich, expansive soundscapes
