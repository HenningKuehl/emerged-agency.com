Iglooghost is a London-based artist who creates music, videos, and images. Signed to Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder imprint at just 18, his work all takes place within a fictional world called Mamu - inhabited by strange little gods and giant floating slugs. Mamu has its very own language, alphabet, biology, and much more - which are all expanded on more and more with each release.
