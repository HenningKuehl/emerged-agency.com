30/70 is a cosmic mélange of boom-bap dynamics, neo-soul harmonies and
 jazz-funk licks, all steeped in a deep spiritual tradition, reaching from Alice
 Coltrane to Kamasi Washington.
 Despite their influences coming from across the pacific, the 30/70 sound is
 unmistakably Melbourne and for anyone admiring the scene from afar, it would
 seem fair to wonder if there was something in the water.
30/70 are the latest collective to emerge from this buzzing soul scene.
 Melbourne’s relative isolation could in fact be a blessing in disguise. It's resulted
 in a pressure cooker of talent; a tight-knit, well practiced network of musicians
 and 30/70 are leading the pack with their latest offering, ‘Elevate’.
Working closely with Paul Bender of Hiatus Kaiyote and Jamil Zacharia to
produce their newly released record, the sound is a sublime statement; at once a
cry for help and a call to arms, it balances delicate poetry and potent aggression
with ease - all of this done with a beguiling pop sensibility.
The band came of age in the wake of Melbourne’s soul scene hitting global
success, a local phenomenon which shone a light on the Northside community
and paved the way for a new generation of bands to take this sound and make it
their own.
 Lovingly referred to as a community rather than a band, 30/70 is, at its core,
 made up of Allysha Joy, Ziggy Zeitgeist, Horatio Luna, Thhomas, Chaser & JK.
 Forever delivering their signature hypnotic groove.
‘Elevate’, their second studio effort after their debut LP, ‘Cold Radish Coma', is
set to launch them to the international stage. Under the management of
Wondercore Island (Hiatus Kaiyote, Oscar Key Sung, Daniel Merriweather) and
with the release dropped on Bradley Zero's Rhythm Section Intl. (Al Dobson Jr,
Silent Jay x Jace XL, Henry Wu), 30/70 are ready to take their message from
Northcote to the world.
