James Holden and Wacław Zimpel met in the summer of 2018 for an improv session in the former's London studio. Their goal was to complete one track per day, creating in-the-moment lyrical conversations between alto clarinet and modular synth. Now, the duo will present their love of all things hypnotic and trancey live, in a world premiere at Unsound 2019, ahead of the record release in early 2020.
