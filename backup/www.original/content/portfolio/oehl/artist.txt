Oehl are the Viennese songwriter Ari Oehl and Icelandic multi-instrumentalist Hjörtur Hjörleifsson. Oehl are German lyrics growing in an especially tight-knit atmosphere where melancholy meets ease, where floating meets dance. Transition is what might best describe Oehl’s offering. It is music for dusk and dawn, for the hazy lines between alertness and a night of deep sleep.

Oehl operate at the interface of music, literature and art, stretching to olfactory by creating a perfume smelling the way the music sounds: forest soil and a certain yearning that encompasses listeners, taking them on a journey that has found its destination in the journey itself; with feet like a dream dancer, in the ear a longing place.

Short Bio:
Oehl - the Austro-Icelandic duo around songwriter Ari Oehl and the multi-instrumentalist Hjörtur Hjörleifsson - is danceable rhythms interwoven with Nordic melancholy. Oehl is at the same time danceable and picturesque, engaging and present. Once in the ear, always in the ear.

Ariel (born 1988) and Hjörtur (born 1991) got to know each other in 2007 at a party in Salzburg (Austria). After they watched each other's career from afar, they began to make music together in the summer of 2016.
As a basis for the musical collaboration Ariel collected German lyrics and song ideas. But only since the cooperation with Hjörtur a certain satisfaction arose. In the early summer of 2017, Oehl got together with Marco Kleebauer (Leyya, Ant Antic, Karma Art) as their producer who is equally enthusiastic about the Oehl project and perfectly complements the creative team with his input.
