Rising pop star Dorian Electra (pronouns: they/them/theirs) makes music that defies gender norms. In the past year, their work has gained a rapidly growing queer cult following as well as critical praise from Pitchfork, Billboard, Paper Magazine, The Fader, and more. Each one of Electra’s high-concept singles (“Career Boy,” “Man To Man,” “Flamboyant,” “Daddy Like”) has been accompanied by a hyper-stylized music video that helps build a bigger world around each song than the music alone. Electra has collaborated and toured with pop visionary Charli XCX and Russian group Pussy Riot as well as played major pride festivals across the US. 2019 welcomes the release of Dorian Electra’s debut full-length album “Flamboyant,” an unapologetically over-the top work of experimental pop with a heavy-metal, baroque twist that is being supported by their first-ever headlining tour.
