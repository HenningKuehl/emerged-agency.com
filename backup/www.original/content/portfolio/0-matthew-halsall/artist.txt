Matthew Halsall performs music from his latest album, Salute to the Sun, with his new band.
A trumpeter whose unflashy, soulful playing radiates a thoughtful beauty and a composer and band-leader, Halsall, has created his own rich sound world. A sound that draws on the heritage of British jazz, the spiritual jazz of Alice Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders, as well as world music and electronica influences, and even modern art and architecture, to create something uniquely his own. A music that is rooted in Northern England but draws on global inspirations.

Salute to the Sun is his first album as a leader since Into Forever (2015) and marks the debut of his new band. A hand-picked ensemble featuring some of Manchester’s finest young musicians. The album draws inspiration from themes and ideas that have inspired Halsall through the years (on albums such as Oneness, Fletcher Moss Park and When the World Was One) ideas of ecology, the environment and harmony with nature.

Matthew Halsall trumpet, Matt Cliffe saxophone & flute, Maddie Herbert harp, Liviu Gheorghe piano, Gavin Barras bass, Alan Taylor drums and Jack McCarthy drums.

*“'Kind of Blue' meets The Cinematic Orchestra ...”. *
**Time Out**

*“Combines deep, mellow modal grooves and cascading harp glissandi with sublime soloing to
create something that’s simultaneously refreshing and relaxing” *
**★★★★★ Record Collector **

*Matthew Halsall’s Salute to the Sun heads up a bunch of albums that sound as much like a
scorching August afternoon as the pop-hiss of a freshly opened can of Rio. *
**The Guardian**

*Matthew Halsall asserts himself as a living legend amongst his spiritual jazz peers with this new
album. Salute to the Sun tingles from start to finish, with the raised hairs from your goosebumps reaching out to connect with the warmth of Halsall's oozing trumpet. *
**★★★★★ Jazz Revelations **
