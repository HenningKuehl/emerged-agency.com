Chances are, if you are anywhere near the Detroit music scene, you have heard of the influential hip hop trio that makes up Slum Village. The group was founded in the early 90?s by 3 childhood friends: Baatin, T3, rapper and producer J Dilla, who all grew up together in the Conant Gardens neighbourhood of Detroit, MI. At present, the evolution of Slum Village continues with a reinvigorated energy, with founding member T3 holding down the legacy, and grammy nominated producer Young RJ and Illa j, the young prodigy at his side. Slum Village has a new mixtape “Dirty Slums”, presented by DJ Mick Boogie, and after 100,000 + downloads and rave reviews, the group released an official full length album and are planning on a sequel.
When Slum Village emerged in the late 1990s, the highly regarded Detroit trio of T3, Baatin and Jay Dee made a startling admission: their group was a liquid association with members coming and going during the group’s evolution. True to their word, Slum Village has already gone through a number of line-up changes.
Rapper-producer Jay Dee left after the group’s first national album, 2000’s Fantastic, Vol. 2 (Barak) and rhymer Elzhi was added to the mix for 2002’s Trinity (Past, Present And Future) (Barak/Capitol). Now, with the release of Slum Village’s new album, the stunningly impressive Detroit Deli (Barak/Capitol), the group consists of just T3 and Elzhi. Throughout the changes, Slum Village’s musical mission has remained constant: to deliver soul-stirring sonics that represent Detroit to the fullest. That vision is fully realized on Detroit Deli. Throughout the sensational 15-cut collection, T3 and Elzhi give listeners an intimate look at life in The D, from where they shop, hang with friends and eat to the type of cars they drive (check “Zoom”) and what clothes they wear.
