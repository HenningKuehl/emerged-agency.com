Brazilian producer and vocalist LYZZA “has risen to become one of electronic music’s most promising young avant pop producers” - Beatport. In the last few years she’s familiarised herself with the alternative music scene and has worked herself from Amsterdam, where she spent her teenage years, to London where she currently lives. 
While teaching herself how to produce in her bedroom and working towards what would be her first release ‘Powerplay’; LYZZA kickstarted her career in 2016 playing DJ-sets at vogue balls in Amsterdam, but quickly paved her way into international clubs all over Europe & Asia, eventually becoming a resident at Amsterdam’s favourite club : De School, and Mykki Blanco’s tour DJ after the two connected.
Since her debut EP, Powerplay, exploded in 2017 (and has been used as soundtrack by CHROMAT and Mugler in their runway shows), LYZZA has been one to keep up with. On the one hand, this is down to her music. LYZZA’s sound stands apart, erring more towards whole compositions than tracks built specifically for the club. On the other, it’s because of a reputation she’s growing as someone who speaks their mind and is here to change things by showing people that there are ways to do things outside of the status quo if you’re willing to try hard enough.
IMPOSTER, her second EP released in 2018 solidified LYZZA as an composer, lyricist and more than just a club kid; Which ended up earning her the title of “Artist shaping the future of music; for generations to come” by Crack Magazine, and performances at Europe’s biggest festivals like Sonar, Melt!, Pukkelpop, Montreux Jazz Festival, and Primavera sound where she was named one of the “Best of Primavera sound 2018” by Pitchfork.
2019 has seen LYZZA take herself into a more poppier music realm and broke her tracks into Radio-waves with her latest 6-track release “DEFIANCE”. Which includes a collaboration with Hot Chips’ Joe Goddard and Jungle’s Tom McFarland. Her previous releases had already set her up as a brilliant singer and songwriter, but they were darker, less spacious, and mostly club focused. 
Given the short time frame LYZZA has been releasing music, to get to this level of quality is remarkable. But she is also hinting that the best is yet to come. - The Quietus
