An American electronic musician, film composer and sound designer who utilises a plethora of computer programs to reshape her voice into dense, unsettling sound constructions.

Gately's unpredictable compositions run from industrial collages to playful, abstract pop tunes, exhibiting an absurdist sense of humour and an ear for rhythm and melody. Gately moves to Houndstooth for her new album, Loom, following the release of her debut album Color on TriAngle Records in 2016.

Gately has also released an array of limited EPs and a cassette on a number of notable underground labels – Public Information and Blue Tapes, as well as the critically acclaimed FatCat Split Series. She has also remixed Bjork and co-produced serpentwithfeet's debut LP soil.

This summer Gately was part of the recent Mary Anne Hobbs curated ‘Queens of the Underground’ Festival in Manchester alongside Houndstooth musician Aisha Devi. She is currently living in LA and teaching at CalArts.
