The Glitch Mob – the Los Angeles-based trio comprising Justin
Boreta, Ed Ma, and Joshua Mayer – continues their forward movement into 2018. Boreta, edIT, and Ooah came together around 2006, passing through various members until settling on this core trio of musicians. Together, they combined their different skills and aesthetics into the compellingly collaged whole that has become one of the most beloved live electronic acts, and distinctive recording artists, working today.
