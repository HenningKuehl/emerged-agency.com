Text: 

A young composer, half French, half German once composed a song. 
By chance a renown tech house producer stumbles upon it. On his 18th birthday he sends him the finished track as a present. This is followed by a DIY release and the rise to a worldwide hit, which has been streamed by millions to date. 
So begins the fairy tale of Gabriel Vitel and "Mind Doodles". And the threads from which this fabulous story is spun are glittering. On the one hand there are Gabriel's soulful, strikingly rough voice, his wonderful melodies and on the other hand the relaxed, yet driving beats and sound patterns of producer Alec Troniq. 
You just can't help yourself but be in a good mood when you listen to these sounds. And so we dream on together with Gabriel Vitel and let our thoughts dance.
