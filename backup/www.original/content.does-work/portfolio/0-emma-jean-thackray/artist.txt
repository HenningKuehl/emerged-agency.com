Emma-Jean Thackray is an award winning composer/ producer/ arranger/ instrumentalist/ singer and as a recent RBMA alumni, has been described by RBMA as "one of the UK's most exciting new jazz artists", as “somewhere between Madlib and Ornette Coleman” by Djam La Revue, “one to watch” by the London Evening Standard and as “supremely talented... the sound of South London” by Sounds Of The Universe.

Her recent release WALRUS is gaining a lot of underground support and sits in the collections of some of the worlds' finest vinyl selectors including Theo Parrish, Chairman Jeff Mao, Mr Scruff, Gilles Peterson and more, and was described by Rhythm Section as "one of the most exciting and unique jazz records of 2016".

Having trained at top UK conservatories in both jazz and composition she is pretty fucking good at loads of stuff, with acclaimed work as a producer, as a composer for large ensembles, as an arranger, a musical director, an educator, a solo performer and as a band leader with her quintet WALRUS. Her performances have taken her to renowned London venues such as Jazz Café, South Bank and Bussey Building to European festivals, across the pond to North America, and onto the same bills as Tanya Tagaq, Fucked Up, Suzanne Ciani, Fatima, The Eglo Live Band, Poppy Adjudha, Oscar Jerome, Alice Phoebe Lou and many more. Emma-Jean Thackray is one of the next big names in Nu-Jazz.
