Mykki Blanco is a writer, activist and international performing artist. In 2010 Quattlebaum first began making crushing industrial punk under the moniker No Fear before beginning a video art project that would grow to be the glamorous riot grrrl rap of Mykki Blanco.

In 2012, Mykki burst into the music scene with the 'Mykki Blanco and the Mutant Angels' EP. Later in 2012 Blanco dropped the seminal 'Cosmic Angel Mixtape', that featured Mykki's first wave of hits 'Wavvy', 'Haze Boogie Life' and 'Kingpinning'.

On May 21, 2013 Blanco released his second work 'Betty Rubble: The Initiation' EP. In January of 2015 Mykki partnered with !K7 to create her own imprint DOGFOOD Music Group, a label that aims to give voice to underground artists that share her vision and "transcend conventional cultural boundaries / constructs." The first DMG release titled C-ORE, a new compilation project, was out on Sept 18. Mykki is currently working on her solo album.
