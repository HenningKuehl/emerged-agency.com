Who is Malaa? 
All we know is that he's got some pretty bangin' house tunes and friends in the right places.

The cabal of Parisian producers that includes DJ Snake, Tchami and Mercer has been responsible for some of the biggest hits in dance music over the past couple years, so when rumblings of a new kid on their block come about, it's probably time to take note.

A series of mixes, a Major Lazer remix, and a freshly-released remix of Tchami's "After Life" have flown out of the SoundCloud account of Malaa, a heretofore unknown producer. Well, actually, the balaclava-clad mystery man is still unknown because he's hiding his identity.
His 'Who is Malaa' mixes on SoundCloud are nothing but gold. 
One thing we do know: Malaa is probably not dubstep progenitor Mala.
