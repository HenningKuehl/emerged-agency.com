With an accolade of releases on independent labels 22a, Rhythm Section International and Eglo Records, Henry Wu has solidified his place as one of the most exciting and eclectic producers to emerge from the UK.

A stalwart in the art of collaboration, Henry has worked with K15 under the guise of WU15, Tito Wun and his most recent, with Hard House Banton. Wu is also the co-founder of Yussef Kamaal who have taken the world by storm with their debut album ‘Black Focus’. Drawing from different ends of the musical spectrum, his diversity on record is also apparent in his DJ sets, spanning the breadth of broken beat, house, jazz and funk.

In 2016 Henry Wu curated a series of sell out shows at the London Jazz Cafe whereby he gathered musicians from around the world to replay the works of legendary musicians such as Jaco Pastorius and Freddie Hubbard.

He is a musician of many talents, from sell out shows in London to playing extensively at clubs and festivals across Europe, North America, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Consistently championed by the likes of Benji B, Gilles Peterson, Alexander Nut, Mary Anne Hobbs and Toddla T.
