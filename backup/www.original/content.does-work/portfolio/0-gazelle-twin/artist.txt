Gazelle Twin is the moniker for performance artist, composer and producer Elizabeth Bernholz. Her conceptual albums present dystopian themes through unconventional electronic production and extraordinary live performances which feature changing personas.

Her widely acclaimed second album ‘UNFLESH’ (Anti-Ghost Moon Ray/Last Gang, September 2014) was a personal yet visceral depiction of puberty, phobia, gender identity told through a spectrum of choral voices and spoken word, backed by unrelenting industrial-pop production. The accompanying live show toured internationally from 2013 - 2015 during a period which established her place as an innovator in contemporary electronic music.

Gazelle Twin’s latest project, live show, Kingdom Come is inspired by J.G Ballard's final novel, and explores tribalism, social conditioning and fascism in the contemporary suburban and consumer landscape. Commissioned by Future Everything Festival 2016 (Manchester, UK), the audio-visual performance features two vocalists on treadmills, set against a series of films and animated text by regular collaborators Chris Turner and Tash Tung.
