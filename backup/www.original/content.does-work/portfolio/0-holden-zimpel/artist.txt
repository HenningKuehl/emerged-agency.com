Text: James Holden and Wac≈Çaw Zimpel met in the summer of 2018 for an improv session in the former's London studio. Their goal was to complete one track per day, creating in-the-moment lyrical conversations between alto clarinet and modular synth. Now, the duo will present their love of all things hypnotic and trancey live, in a world premiere at Unsound 2019, ahead of the record release in early 2020.
