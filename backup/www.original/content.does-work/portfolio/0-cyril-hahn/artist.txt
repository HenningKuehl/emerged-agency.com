Over the last 2 years the industry has come to know and love the signature, ethereal sounds of the producer CYRIL HAHN.

In the early part of his career the Bern, Switzerland native was known for his remix work of Solange, Jessie Ware, Haim, Sigur Ros and the ever-popular Destiny’s Child remix of "Say My Name".

After signing with the heavyweight label PMR Records, he demonstrated an added depth to his production with two popular EPs Perfect Form (2013) and Voices (2014), collaborating both with up and coming vocalists like Shy Girls and Rochelle Jordan, and fellow label mates Ryan Ashley and Javeon.

Cyril’s work continues to hit a significant nerve with fans and other artists causing a growing demand for touring. He has played around the globe headlining sold out shows and billed at some of the world’s most popular music festivals including Bestival (UK), Osheaga (Canada) Falls Festival (Australia), Roskilde (Denmark), Osheaga (Canada) Bestival (UK) and Fuji Rock Festival (Japan).
