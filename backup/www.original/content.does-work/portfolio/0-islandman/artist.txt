Born from the musical dreams of Istanbul based musician/producer Tolga Boyuk, Islandman represents a fictional character, a music persona, a dreamer composing the stories of a non-existing place...

Islandman performs on stage as an electro-acoustic live trio format. Their music can be described as a unique mix of mellow electronic structures & dance beats with spacey live guitars, backed up by shamanic rhythms.
The mixing idea during the record sessions or in live performances is to bring Turkish Psychedelia or an African roots music reef together with a feeling of the electric universe. The power of the band comes from their perfect balance of electronic structures and acoustical harmonies.

Their first single ‘ Agit ‘ (Requiem) was also the piece that connected the band with the Danish label 'Music for Dreams'. After the successful liftoff, the band released their first long play ‘ Rest in Space ‘ from the same label in 2017. The album hit the first place by the number of downloads in the following weeks in their respected genre.

In 2018 Islandman mostly focused on touring and had a successful tour including performances in Cappadox, Sunbeat Festival, Apple Flower Festival, Istanbul Jazz Festival, Monteux Jazz festival and Boom Festival. The musical diversity of those festivals yet the selection including Islandman in their programme was a positive sign towards Tolga Boyuk’s dream of composing universal sounds.
