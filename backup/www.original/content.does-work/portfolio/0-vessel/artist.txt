Vessel is the musical alias of London based composer Sebastian Gainsborough, an artist that commands increasing levels of attention from producers of more immersive anamorphic content. After rising to prominence through a series of singles, the first album “Order of Noise” was released on experimental mainstay Tri-Angle Records. 

In 2014 the sophomore album, “Punish, Honey” was released to widespread critical acclaim with the single “Red Sex” being lofted via the trailer for Park Chan-Wook’s “The Handmaiden”. After an extended period of touring, writing and maturation through artistic residencies the third record “Queen of Golden Dogs”, was released in late 2018. 

Drawing heavily from classical and live instrumentation, as well as from contemporary electronics, the long player signifies a profound change in Vessel's writing and style.
 A founding member of Bristol's Young Echo Collective, and alumni of renowned residencies from Aldeburgh Music, Tate and Somerset House, Vessels’ music has an affinity with premium brands seeking genre agnostic cues as evidenced by Damir Doma and Far Cry 5. Currently Vessel is preparing to tour a new collaboration with virtuoso violinist Rakhi Singh and writing original commissions for film.
