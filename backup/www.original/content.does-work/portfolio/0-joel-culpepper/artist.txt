In an uncertain world, one thing is for sure; Joel Culpepper has an unforgettable voice and a distinctive style that defy comparison.

Blazing into 2019 with a sizzling slice of bittersweet sunshine soul, Joel and long term collaborator and producer Swindle team up with UK rapper Kojey Radical for latest track, 'Caroline, No'. 
Following hard on the heels of Colors of Berlin release 'Woman', which has racked up over 5 million YouTube views and 2 million+ Spotify streams, and a guest vocal spot on DJ Yoda's 'London Fields', 'Caroline, No' is the sublime first fruits of an eagerly awaited debut album. 
Bringing together timeless soul music with seductive and sensual vocals, the album, due for release this year, features collaborations with FKJ, Swindle, Redinho and Guy Chambers, among a litany of stellar musical talent.

Previous releases, including the 'Skydive' EP and 'Tortoise' saw the cream of the music scene including Grammy award winning producer Jimmy Hogarth, Roy Davis Jr., and Jools Holland's Musical Director Phil Veacock, queueing up to work with Joel. 
His 'Afraid to Be King' single was a BBC Radio 6 Music Record of the Week earning him a Gilles Peterson session, with further radio support for Joel coming from Lauren Laverne, Annie Mac, Chris Hawkins, Huw Stephens, Trevor Nelson, Mary Anne Hobbs, DJ Target, Toddla T, Charlie Sloth, Jamie East and Steve Lamacq.

But it is the dynamism, energy and impact of his live shows where Joel is at his undeniable best. 
Recent outings, including a European tour, a sell-out show at the Jazz CafeÃÅ and appearances at Camp Bestival, Reeperbahn, Holy Groove festival, Standon Calling, Wilderness festival, LIM festival, All Points East, and The Great Escape have showcased honest, real and transcendent music with a vocal talent that is as rare as it is exceptional.
