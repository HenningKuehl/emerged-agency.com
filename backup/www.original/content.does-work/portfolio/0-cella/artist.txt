Text: A young talent has emerged from the electronic music scene of Zurich that looks quite promising indeed. At only 21 years of age, Cella has achieved a unique balance between trap and future bass that’s catapulted him into the international orbit. The producer and instrumentalist accompanies ambitious touring with the diligent stockpiling of music, and now he’s chosen six singles for his upcoming effort, Opportunity Cost out in May 2019 via Quartz Records / Universal Music.
