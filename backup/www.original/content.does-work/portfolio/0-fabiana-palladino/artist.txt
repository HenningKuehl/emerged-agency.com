Having spent recent years working alongside artists such as Sampha, Jessie Ware, SBTRKT and The Maccabees, producer and multi-instrumentalist Fabiana Palladino moved into a new realm, with late 2017’s celestial single Mystery being released on Jai and A.K. Paul’s Paul Institute to wide acclaim.

July 2018 saw the release of Palladino’s first self-produced track Shimmer.  With heavy percussion channelling Sheila E and a subtle mysticism influenced by the likes of Kate Bush, Shimmer creates a unique feminine power of its own – one that has grabbed the attention of several radio stalwarts including Annie Mac and Benji B, as well as singular pop icon Robyn, who championed Palladino as an artist to watch in her recent Dazed & Confused guest edit.

By combining meticulously crafted pop songwriting with bold and inventive production choices, Palladino has found an exciting sound of her own – one deeply rooted in her influences, whilst looking determinedly ahead to the future.
