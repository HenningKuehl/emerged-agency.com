Text: With more than a decade and a half of industry experience and a rich catalog of recordings, Black Milk has transitioned from one of hip-hop’s rising stars to a genre-bending virtuoso with a well-rounded pedigree as a producer, rapper & performer. Acclaimed by outlets such as Pitchfork, Rolling Stone & The Wall Street Journal, the Detroit-born artist has released seven solo rap albums, a handful of EPs and instrumental projects, and has collaborated with numerous artists, including Jack White, Mick Jenkins & Danny Brown (most recently producing Danny Brown’s “Really Doe” ft. Kendrick Lamar, Earl Sweatshirt and Ab-Soul). Adventurously blending trap, neo-soul, R&B and hip-hop into an electrifying stew, Black Milk look into the future on his new EP - DiVE - with a renewed perspective on the world and his place in it. Three tracks from Black’s ambitious 2018 album, FEVER, represented different stages of change - “unVEil,” the initial thought; “eVE,” the moment before leaping, and “DiVE,” the moment of action. DiVE, the EP, is an elaboration on the moments of change for Black Milk - changing the way he sees (or chooses not to see) the world, his creative identity, his place in the rap sphere & the shedding of old ways. As he looks toward the 2020s, Black also contemplates his legacy, as he rhymes on project highlight “Relate (Want 2 Know),” featuring his younger brother MAHD: “Always in it for the long game/Only decision I ever choose/Let the people put you on a pedestal/ Legacies live longer than legends do.“ DiVE is out now via Mass Appeal Records & Black Milk’s label Computer Ugly.
