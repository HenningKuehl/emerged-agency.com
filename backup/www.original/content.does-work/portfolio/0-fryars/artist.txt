Fryars is the musical brainchild of London-based 24 year old Benjamin Garrett, who’s peerless sound has won him fans from Kanye West to Depeche Mode, and seen him tour with acts as diverse as London Grammar and Wild Beasts. He co-wrote two tracks on Lily Allen’s number one album Sheezus and sometimes plays live with her, most recently a short notice headline performance at Latitude Festival. Fryars also features on - and produced - Cold, the new Rae Morris single.

His first album, "Power" was written, programmed and sung by Fryars as “a soundtrack to a film that does not exist.” The album’s sixteen tracks are a labour of love linked together by a script, written specifically for the record. “I want each track to play on a different place and moment in time,” explains Fryars. “To take you on that journey without picture.”

The album was produced by Fryars and Luke Smith, with additional production by Rodaidh McDonald (the xx, How to Dress Well, Savages), and includes the critically acclaimed singles Cool Like Me and The Power.
