The son of a Congolese master percussionist, born and raised in NZ listening to hip hop, jazz and dance music, as an artist Myele Manzanza brings an eclectic style and diverse skill to his craft to create a genre bending experience rooted in jazz and African rhythm. Manzanza is a powerful drummer who has earned himself a reputation as a composer with vision, and a  musician who is not afraid to experiment. 
As a drummer and a sideman he continues to tour internationally and collaborate with a broad range of artists across multiple genres including Theo Parrish, Mark de Clive-Lowe, Ross McHenry, The Adelaide Symphony Orchestra, Amp Fiddler, Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, Ria Hall, Marcus Strickland, Recloose, Sorceress, Jordan Rakei and countless others. 
Manzanza works hard to establish himself on the world stage, whether it’s being selected from over 20,000 applicants to participate in the Red Bull Music Academy in London, solo album releases on esteemed international labels Sound Signature, First Word and BBE, or his sophomore album OnePointOne’s nomination for the 2017 NZ Jazz Album of the Year. 

In June 2019, Manzanza will release his eagerly anticipated third album A Love Requited on First Word Records UK. Produced with Australian musical collaborator Ross McHenry, ‘ALR’ is as much a musical journey as it is an attempt to process, work through and come to terms with the life around him.
