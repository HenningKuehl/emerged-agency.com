Egopusher are a Swiss, instrumental Electronica duo consisting of Tobias Preisig (violin, synths) and Alessandro Giannelli (drums, synths). Their sound is a mixture of elegant, analog Electronica, with a touch of Neo Contemporary. 

The project started as a string of late night conversations which took place in Tobias’ vintage BMW, while the two of them would drive back together from gigs, as session musicians with Dieter Meier’s Out of Chaos (note: Dieter Meier is one-half of the legendary YELLO). 

The official beginning of Egopusher can be traced back to their first show as a duo, a fully improvised affair which took place in November 2013, at the off-space Perla Mode, back in Zürich. The show was epic. An avalanche of live events followed, this led to a self-titled EP – the rest is history in the making.
