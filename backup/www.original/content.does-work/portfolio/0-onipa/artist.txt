Afro grooves, electronics and fierce energy.

ONIPA means ‘human’ in Akan, the ancient language of the Ashanti people of Ghana. It’s a message of connection through collaboration: from Ghana to London, our ancestors to our children, Onipa brings energy, groove, electronics, afrofuturism, dance and fire!

Born out of deep collaboration between long time friends KOG (Kweku of Ghana of KOG and the Zongo Brigade) and Tom Excell (MD, guitarist and writer of acclaimed jazz/soul afrobeat pioneers Nubiyan Twist), the 4 piece live show features KOG on vocals, balafon and percussion, Tom Excell on guitar, percussion and electronics, Dwayne Kilvington (Wonky Logic) on synths and MPC and Finn Booth (Nubiyan Twist) on drums.

It’s a fresh, raw, fiercely energetic new sound, fusing electronics and deep afro grooves. Think Konono no.1 meets Shangaan Electro, Songhoy Blues and Débruit...

Fresh out of the box but already with some major shows under their belt including The Great Escape (UK), Eurosonic (NL), Young African Commonwealth (AUS) and 23 shows in 7 different countries planned for summer 2019... “We no Be Machine”
