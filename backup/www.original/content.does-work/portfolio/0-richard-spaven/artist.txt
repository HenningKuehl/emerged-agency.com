Richard introduces us to his personal musical journey. The moment in time where a jazz drummer affirms his love for club culture, delivering an album that explores and defies genres, from Drum ’n’ Bass to Broken Beat to Dubstep and more, seen through the lens of a drummer. All combined with Richard's unique subtle style, which has made him a sought-after performer with many great artists as well as at drum shows and festivals around the world.

Richard Spaven has gained international recognition and praise for supplying the drums for many artists on stage and in the studio. José James, Guru's Jazzmatazz, Flying Lotus, The Cinematic Orchestra, TY and more recently Jameszoo. Working closely with a diverse range of artists has made him a genre-defying drummer.
