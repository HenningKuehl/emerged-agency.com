His 1998 highly touted solo debut, Internal Affairs, crafted one of the greatest underground Hip-Hop albums ever with soul driven melody on songs like “Queens” and the crowd moving hit, “Simon Says”, which became a monster single, propelling Monch to commercial success.

Four singles have been releasedfrom the album: “Shine”, “Clap (One Day)”, “Black Hand Side”, and “Assassins”.
