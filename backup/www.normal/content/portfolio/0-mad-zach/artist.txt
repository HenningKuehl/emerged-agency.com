Mad Zach combines sonic influences from hip-hop, glitch, dnb, and dub and trap, yet still remains unique in his own right.
Zach releases his next EP, Fortress, on March 10th 2017 via Plasma Audio. Fortress is lead by single “Robovox,” premiered by MixMag in February. The EP serves as a follow up to Quantum Shock, which featured collaborations from G Jones and Sayer as well as remixes from Bleep Bloop, Amp Live, Conrank, and Pixelord.
Mad Zach’s live sets fuse the elements of controllerism, finger drumming, and DJing into one. He is set for a North American tour and an appearance at What the Festival in 2017, with more show dates to be announced soon. Zach is strongly endorsed by production tech companies Native Instruments and Ableton and his performance videos for them and predominant DJ blog, DJ Tech Tools, have garnered over 10 million views on YouTube.

Nominated for Best Newcomer at DJ Mag’s Best of North America Awards 2017
