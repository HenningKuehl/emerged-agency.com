Text:

Singer/Songwriter Jordan Mackampa is often described as a troubadour, an artist with timeless soul and lyrics drenched in heart felt empathy. As a man who was born in Kinshasa, grew up in London and became an artist in Coventry, Jordan’s music is swimming in the sounds and stories of the cities he’s inhabited over the years.

His critically acclaimed debut EP “Physics” was celebrated for its unique combination of jazz soaked beats, folk melodies and effortless gospel harmonies as well as his poet like lyricism exploring love, longing and loss by the likes of NME, The 405, Julie Adengua and Clash Magazine


With a follow up EP shortly on its way Jordan says, “there’s a smokier, darker sound to this one, it reflects the times we’re living in and poets and artists I’ve been immersing myself in.”
