Text:

Matt Woods, born and raised in Cornwall, moved to London to pursue his passion in music. Having spent his childhood singing in the Truro Cathedral choir, Matt developed a love for vocal harmony that is clear in his music - combining a stunning male falsetto with minimal electronic production.
Following on from his tracks 'In The Dark', which made the BBC Introducing playlist in April 2015, and 'Impression'which reached #5 on Spotify's Global Viral Chart, Matt Woods returns with 'Ain't No Use'.
A real statement of intent for 2016, 'Ain't No Use' hit #2 on the HypeM chart and cements Matt as one to watch this year.
