Text:

Mura Masa is an 18 year old producer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist from the Channel Islands. After a childhood learning guitar, piano, drums and writing with local bands, he turned his hand to production, taking influence from a newly found interest in hip-hop and the art of sampling. With cues from modern electronic acts such as Hudson Mohawke, James Blake and Cashmere Cat he has quickly gathered a loyal online following and over 1 million plays of his tracks. Alex's music combines the energy of electronic production and club culture with the rustic and organic sounds and timbres of traditional vinyl beatmaking.

His efforts are culminated in his forthcoming mixtape, 'Soundtrack to a Death', a fifteen track exploration of his progress so far set for release this November. He will play his first live show in January 2015 to celebrate the release.
