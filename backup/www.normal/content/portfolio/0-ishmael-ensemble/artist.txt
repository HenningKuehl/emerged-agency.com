Ishmael started releasing deep house tracks on Wolf Music before stepping out of the box with the release of his debut album “Sometime In Space” in 2016. The record is an exploration of dusty soundscapes &amp; off-kilter house which Ishmael then developed into a Live A/V show with visual artist Amie Nowlan, watch their Boiler Room performance here.

2017 sees the multi-instrumentalist embark on his most ambitious venture yet with the launch of the Ishmael Ensemble. Their debut record “Songs For Knotty” on Banoffee Pies Records takes the listener on an emotional journey through jazz &amp; ambient music, with support from from the likes of Gilles Peterson, Alexander Nut &amp; Tom Ravenscroft.
