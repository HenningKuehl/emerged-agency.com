Following on from his R&amp;S debut '55 5's, a 10-track mind-bending beat tape that bristled with promise and originality, Sporting Life, producer for New York rap group Ratking, returns to the label for a trio of EPs titled 'Slam Dunk'.
Comprised of ear-popping instrumentals, illustrious remixes, guest vocals and even a range of apparel, 'Slam Dunk' sees Sporting Life drawing on his love for Takehiko Inoue's massively popular manga series of the same name, and the stupendous grace, power and agility of the storied basketball greats.
Guests are drawn from Sport's friends and contemporaries including Actress, Dev Hynes, Wiki, Novelist, Evy Jane, Dean Blunt and Galcher Lustwerk.
Sporting Life is without doubt one of the most original producers at work today, managing to pack in more ideas per minute than most beat makers manage in a whole career.
