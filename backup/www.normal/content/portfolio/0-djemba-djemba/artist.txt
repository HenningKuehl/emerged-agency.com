Text:

“Djemba Djemba is music born from a state of permanent contradiction, held together by one underlying and adaptive principle: rhythm. Experimenting with polyrhythms, 90’s FM synths, and the all-important 808 Kick, Djemba Djemba crafts a sound that is both intelligent and brain numbing.
It’s easy to detect the influence of UK Bass music currently dominating clubs, yet at the same time feel altogether new, and in stride with the response taking place in New York, Chicago, Boston, and his home in Los Angeles.
