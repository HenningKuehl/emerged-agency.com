Shlohmo is the creation of 22-year-old Henry Laufer, LA-native and visual artist turned selftaught musician. As a founding member of the WEDIDIT collective (RL Grime, Groundislava, D33j, Purple, 2kwtvr, Juj, Nick Melons), Henryâ€™s early work placed him at the forefront of a new wave of rising talent amongst west coast producers. With an effortless grasp on sound design, Laufer combines deceptively simple and emotive melodies, subtle bass drops and swinging slow motion drums. Receiving support from Pitchfork, BBC Radio, the New York Times, NPR, Resident Advisor and many others, Shlohmo leads the way in a new generation of promising young producers with his unique blend of dark and sensual R&B tropes.
