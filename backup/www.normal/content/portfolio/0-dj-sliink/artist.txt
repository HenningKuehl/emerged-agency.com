He took the reigns as Jersey Club's first global star, spreading the genre from humble beginnings in Newark's DIY party spaces to international culture hot spots like London, Paris, Milan and Oslo - not to mention mainstream attention fromMTV, SPIN, Vice, and more. After shooting to post-EDM stardom with a collaborative EP on Fool's Gold withFlosstradamus, soundtracking Paris runways for Alexander Wang and Rick Owens, and playing festivals around the globe, Sliink is entering the next chapter of his career.
The OWSLA Records bossman Skrillex sought out Sliink's diverse club sound as the newest addition to their eclectic roster. Hard at work on his first project for the label, you can trust that Sliink has few tricks up his sleeve for 2016.
