In their songs, Swiss outfit Wolfman craftfully explore a variety of wondrous moods and ambivalent sentiments, combine electronic, pop and blues to glittering, spherical sound structures – but still remaining stunningly catchy. This kind of musical finesse rarely remains unnoticed for very long. Hence, it didn’t come as a surprise that Wolfman’s first single «All Is Random» convinced the jury of the Demotape Clinic at the m4music festival 2013 and earned them the award in the category «Pop». Their second single «Won’t Be Tamed» is a catchy dance tune and was on rotation on various Swiss and German radios for months; the corresponding video clip has been featured in a variety of blogs in- and outside of Switzerland.

After playing various prestigious Swiss festivals like the Musikfestwochen Winterthur, m4music festival 2014, Zürich Openair, For Noise Festival and Bad Bonn Kilbi and a tour across Germany supporting Hercules And Love Affair, Wolfman are now ready to conquer the world. Or the Universe.
