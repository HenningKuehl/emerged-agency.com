‘Nyanza’ is the third album from the cross-cultural Owiny Sigoma Band. A complex, constantly evolving, musical relationship now in its fifth year, the project has seen the band producing music in both Kenya, for their self-titled 2009 album, and in London with the second ‘Power Punch LP’. The group features Nyatiti master Joseph Nyamungu, from Western Kenya, and London-based musicians Tom Skinner, Jesse Hackett and Louis Hackett. The result is a string of striking tracks, the music always feeling raw, the rhythms and sounds reflecting the spontaneous jams from which the records were born.
