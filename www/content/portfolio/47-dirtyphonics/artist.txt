Text: Dirtyphonics storms into 2015 with the new EP “Write Your Future” set for a February release on Dim Mak Records. This after spending 2014 proving that their signature brand of genre-bending bass music has a place on the biggest stages across the globe. Comprised of dynamic French DJ/Producers Charly, Pitchin and Julien, Dirtyphonics conquered festival crowds at UMF Miami, EDC Las Vegas, TomorrowWorld, Mysteryland, and so many more. Meanwhile their continent-spanning tour with Excision took the Dirtyphonics phenomenon to all corners of North America. Recently, they completed their Endless Summer Tour spanning Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand.
Shattering expectations with a blend of electronic, heavy metal, drum & bass, trap, dubstep and electro, it’s a sound the guys come by honestly, having cut their teeth in the Parisian metal scene and the electro French Touch 1.0. The evolution of Dirtyphonics has unleashed a forward-thinking bass music powerhouse that has made its name on defying labels and limitations.
First crash-landing into dance music’s consciousness in chart-topping fashion, their 2008 debut single “French Fuck” became a Beatport #1 Hit. The group quickly became a hot commodity in the remix world, lending their talents to tracks by the likes of Skrillex, Marilyn Manson, Crystal Method, Steve Aoki, Benny Benassi, Borgore, Nero, and Linkin Park. In 2013 Dirtyphonics released their debut album "Irreverence" through Dim Mak Records, which boasted such marquee collaborators as Steve Aoki, Foreign Beggars, and Modestep. As the group readies it’s highly anticipated follow up EP “Write Your Future,” expect the unexpected, but know it’ll be DIRTY
