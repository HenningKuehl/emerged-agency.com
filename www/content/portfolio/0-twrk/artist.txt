Title: TWRK
----
Text: The kings of the mid tempo jams, T W R K, were a mystery before Diplo outed their true identities on air during their first Diplo &amp;Friendsshow on BBC Radio 1xtra. The duo of Benzi &amp; Esentrik hit the scene crushing dance floors from strip clubs, to frat houses, to the main stages of festivals by cranking out dance floor massives, including their global break out "BaDinga"(over 25 million plays on YouTube). Their signature sound has everyone knocking down their door for remixes including Major Lazer, Jason Derulo, Naughty Boy &amp; Wiz Khalifa, Pitbull, and even Diplo himself who's "Biggie Bounce" (TWRK Remix) popped up in the Hollywood blockbuster "Let’s Be Cops". Them T W R K boys have held down a year long residency on BBC Radio 1xtra, toured the globe playing major nightclubs and festivals, dropped their debut selftitled EP, via MAD DECENT,resent club anthem "Do What It Do" with OG Maco, via Capitol/Motown, and have their upcoming single “Wheels In Motion” out June 12th!
