The Magician is the alias of talented DJ/Producer, Stephen Fasano.

One night not so long ago, he appeared from a place between space and time. Apparently he stepped into this world, materializing in a cloud of crystal stars and soft pink smoke. Some claim he’s a former airline pilot who crashed an afterparty – some say it’s all just an illusion, a well performed hoax.

Previously a member of revered Balearic disco duo, Aeroplane, he disembarked that flight and boarded his own magical carpet ride in 2010. He released his debut single ‘I Don’t Know What To Do’ on Kitsune in 2011, then joined forces with Peter (aka Yuksek) for three furthers EPs (Twist , Memory and On My Brain). However, most fans will probably know of The Magician for his killer remixes. Especially his re-work of Lykke Li’s “I Follow Rivers” in 2011 (which has had over 36 Million views on Youtube and chart topping placings across Europe) and Clean Bandit’s “ Rather Be” earlier this year.

Recently signed to Parlophone / Warner Records and joining the Machine Management roster of artists in late 2013, The Magician made his label debut with single “When The Night is Over” and is now set to release his biggest hit to date in the form of the euphoric club anthem “Sunlight“ feat Years &amp; Years.

During this whole time he has also been capturing the imaginations of music fans with his Magic Tapes on Soundcloud. Every month he sifts through new music - exclusives from other artists plus music from fans - crafting these tracks into new DJ mix tapes. He’s up to an impressive 44 so far and along the way gaining a cult following of disco, pop and house fans.    All of which is supported by a busy touring schedule throughout 2014. Everywhere The Magician DJs people come under his spell.
