Title: Maribou State
----
Text: Stuck out in the sticks and yet still managing to rattle city speakers with their vibrant new sounds, there’s no denying that Maribou State are making waves in the UK electronic music scene.

Although Chris Davids’ and Liam Ivory’s sound has cranked up and away from their initial live band days, they have certainly held on to the feel. The haunting vocals that ooze through their current tracks give a well-timed nod to their instrumental days, smoothly fused with oriental chimes and tropical rhythms.

It was in 2011 that the pair started to seep into the souls of their followers after playing at one of Mixmag’s top 10 clubs nights - WAYF. It continued to be a successful year when a mix created for Hush House caught the attention of TFA and they were soon signed onto the label.

The Habitat EP and Got Me Down single were quickly released the same year, although it wasn’t until the dulcet notes of Olivia eased through people’s speakers that the group really started to high tail it. Since then, their remixes of Jagga, 2 Bears, Wretch 32 and Crookers (which soared to number one in The Hype Machine) have earned them an array of followers. The well-respected Eddy Temple Morris of XFM weekly supports the 2 Bears remix and voted Olivia as ‘Tune of the Year’ as well as naming Maribou State his ‘Number one producers’ of 2012.

They are now continuing to live in the rural parts of Hertfordshire, producing all their work at their self-built studio ‘The Shack in the Back’, where a new album is on the horizon for the end of 2012. We can also eagerly await a spine tingling set on the main stage at the Secret Garden Party as well as a much-anticipated collaboration with Groove Armada’s Saint Saviour, amongst others.

Kicking back to the ambience of ‘Gold Image’ or bouncing to their bewitching remix of Lauryn Hill’s ‘Doo Wop’, its easy to see why these boys look set to snatch 2012 by storm!
