Text:

Batuk is a creative collective founded by South African electronic music producers Aero Manyelo and Spoek Mathambo; along with the prolific artist and vocalist Manteiga. The central function of Batuk is to use house music as a vehicle to connect the African diaspora based on shared and exchanged rhythm culture and language. So far the project has done multi-disciplinary collaborations in South Africa, Mozambique and Uganda.

The group are set to release their debut EP, 'Daniel' in January 2016 featuring frequent collaborator Nandi Ndlovu. The single release will be accompanied by a beautiful music video for 'Daniel' shot in Impaputo, Mozambique by director Kent Andreasen.

Batuk is currently completing work on their debut album, set for mid-2016 release. On their brave genre-defying debut album, the collective has collaborated with artists such as Grupo Zore and Grupo Makarita (Mozambique); Giovanni Kiyingi, Annet Nandujja, and Nilotica (Uganda).

2016 will see Batuk performing their exciting live show worldwide.
