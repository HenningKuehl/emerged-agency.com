Not only because he plays house, which is danceable like in the good old 80s, but also because of his funky vibes, the young producer Delakeyz from Zürich has started to allure big crowds. His music reached lots of people in a short time, especially after Majestic Casual posted his track „How You Love“ which alredy has 350.000 views and counting. 
As rarely seen nowadays, he plays his sets live, always unique, jamming and dancing with his fingers over his samplers and synthesizers. 
Delakeys grew up with jazz, funk and soul, which can clearly be heard in his catchy melodies. With his music he wants to spread positive vibes and reate an atmosphere of happiness, peace and joy. 
In less then a year, he has played alongsideacts like Karma Kid, Jaymo & Andy George, Bondax and many more. Let him cast a spell on you and get an imaginaton of how love can be carried over music.
