Sondr are a London based electronic music production and songwriting duo, specialising in their own unique take on dance music - ODM, otherwise known as "organic dance music". Originally working as songwriters and producers for pop music (Lana Del Ray, Meghan Trainor, Ella Eyre) Sondr's Lorenzo Cosi and YK Koi had a chance meeting atTileyard Studio complex, when both of their artist's called in sick last minute.
Within weeks of meeting, their first collaboration was cut by a huge European pop star, which peaked the airplay chart at #2.

Their mutual admiration for live instrumentation, EDM and analogue recording and mixing techniques brought them together to start the project which would soon become Sondr. Combining guitars, live drums, anthemic vocals and electronic dance production, Sondr are equally placed in an arenas as they are in clubs. Their highly anticipated debut single 'Surviving' features Irish folk singer Joe Cleere and combines soaring melodies with upbeat guitars and tropical synths to create the perfect summer anthem.

Sondr are currently in the studio working on follow-up releases with an array of hugely talented writers and featured artists, as well as working on remixes for Benny Benassi,James Newman and many more.
