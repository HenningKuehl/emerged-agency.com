Title: Pardon My French feat. Tchami, Malaa, Mercer
----
Text: Hailing from Paris, Tchami, is no stranger to the dance music industry. Coming on to the scene with his remix of Janet Jackson’s “Go Deep”. The track became an instant over night hit! With much critical acclaim, he soon followed up with his first original production “Promesses” with Kaleem Taylor via Fool’s Gold Records and Ministry of Sound. It was not too long after “Promesses” that Tchami released “Shot Caller” under the same EP for Fool’s Gold Clubhouse. From then on, Tchami subsequently released his remixes of AlunaGeorge’s “You Know You Like It”, JackU’s “Take U There”, and many more. Having gained the support from some of today’s top DJs such as A-Trak, Diplo, Dillon Francis and Skrillex, to name a few.
In March 2015, Tchami released his first single off of his upcoming EP “After Life” as well as the music video. Soon following he released the remix package for the single featuring producers Point Point, Malaa, DJ Snake &amp; Mercer, San Holo, and Jauz. The next single off the EP, titled “Missing You” features AC Slater and the vocal talent of Kaleem Taylor, is set to come out by the end of this month. The exact release date of the whole After Life EP has yet to be announced but it’s something all fans are yearning over! Tchami is taking Europe by storm this summer from the likes of London, Ibiza, Amsterdam, and many more. North Americans will get the chance to experience “The After Life” on his upcoming tour this Fall featuring his own production and music from the EP.
