Title: Talvin Singh
----
Text: Percussionist, producer and composer, Talvin Singh, is renowned for creating the bridge between Indian and electronic music. Drawing Inspiration from the
classical Indian arts, he has managed to sculpt a unique sonic landscape.
Singh’s synthesis of electronic music and eastern aesthetic, is often referred to
as Asian Underground, one of the most exciting movements in the history of
British music.

He has taken the Tabla to the cutting edge with the most unimaginable sonic
creations, which has ultimately helped him to demystify Indian classical music,
and therefore inspire a whole new generation of musicians and producers of
contemporary music in India and the south Asian diaspora worldwide. Singh’s
influence has also spanned to the visual arts, dance and film.
Having worked and collaborated with a diverse range of artists, such as, Sun Ra,
the late Ustad Sultan Khan, Terry Riley, John Martyn and Yoko Ono, he still
continues to be as explorative and imaginative in his solo career as well as
curating new ventures in contemporary music.

Singh’s debut album, titled OK, achieved huge acclaim and won Singh the
Mercury Music Prize in 1999. He has also been honoured with the South Bank
Prize for popular music and was awarded an OBE in 2015 for Services to Music.
Talvin continues to perform internationally, write and produce music and to
work as a music director for various creative projects.

2017 will see performances of solo works from his current repertoire and also
exclusive DJ sets that celebrate 20 years of the Asian Underground.
