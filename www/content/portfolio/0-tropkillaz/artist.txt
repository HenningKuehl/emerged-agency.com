Tropkillaz are the duo formed by Brazil’s top producers from the old and new school: DJ Zegon and Laudz.
DJ Zegon is one of Brazil’s most respected producers and DJs of all time. Former member of N.A.S.A., DJ Zegon’s career spans over 20 years with credits on over 100 records with artists such as Kanye West, M.I.A., David Byrne (Talking Heads), George Clinton, and a few Wu Tang Members (RZA, Method Man, Ol’Dirty Bastard) among others.
Laudz is a new cat in the game, but with only 5 years producing, he’s already worked with rap stars like Snoop Dogg, Dr Dre, as well as the main MCs of Brazil’s new hip hop scene, and has done scores for mives and video-games.
The result of this junction is an intense collection of club bangers that blend many styles from trap and bass music with electro, hip hop, and latin, creating a unique tropical bass sound & style.
The workaholic duo have been busy independently releasing tune after tune on their Soundcloud, reaching tens of millions of plays worldwide - ranging from original tunes, to remixes for Benny Benassi, Major Lazer, to name a few.
In early 2014, the Tropkillaz remix to N.A.S.A’s “Hide” hit #1 on the iTunes Electronic Music Charts in the USA, and peaked at #8 in the UK – further showing that Tropkillaz are heavyweight contenders, charting amongst artists like Disclosure, Major Lazer, M.I.A, and further household names.
This has lead to a non-stop world touring schedule - having in only 2x years done 3x USA Tours, 5x European Tours, 2x Asia Tours, 1x Australian tour, and countless shows in their Native Brazil.
Supported by superstars DJs like Diplo, Major Lazer, Flosstradamus, DJ Snake, Steve Aoki, to old school heroes ranging from Just Blaze to Jazzy Jeff, Q-Bert and Z-Trip, Tropkillaz will finally be having their debut label release on MadDecent for early 2016.
