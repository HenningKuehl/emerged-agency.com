Title: Broken Back
----
Text: Everything started on a costal western french city called Saint-Malo.  Jérôme who would later become Broken Back was born and raised by the inspiring landscape of Bretagne beaches. He played his first notes at an early age, learning classical music and jazz with an unconventional instrument: the tuba.

At 23, he had co-founded 2 start-ups and seemed destined for a bright future. But in 2012 a displaced vertebra forced him to ease off the pace for several months.Inspired to take his nylon guitar out of the closet, Jérôme began writing and recording his first songs.

As he shared his freshly finalised demos online, blogs and people supported his project. Then famous dj’s (Klingande, Kygo, Thomas Jack) contacted him for collaborations.

At the same time, business angels and various opportunities to raise funds for his start-ups showed up. But, instead, Jérôme decided to embrace this nascent music career.
