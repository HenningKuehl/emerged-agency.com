Title: Baloji
----
Text: Baloji is a poet, composer-lyricist/beatmaker, scriptwriter, actor and performer, video artist and stylist. After the release of his album Hotel Impala (2008), his Congolese reinterpretation (Kinshasa Succursale, 2011) was awarded 4 stars by the world’s press (NYT, Guardian, El Pais, Les Inrocks..) and after more than 200 live shows all over the world, Baloji is back with a new EP.
His music stands at the crossroads of African music, rap music, the French singer-songwriter tradition, afro-american music (soul, funk, jazz) discovered through hip hop culture and sampling; and electronic music (trance, deep house) which has its roots in part in the region of Belgium where Baloji grew up.
Baloji means “man of science” in Swahili, but during the colonial period, that meaning shifted to “man of the occult sciences and sorcery”. By placing his resilience at the centre of his work, Baloji reconciles all these influences to enrich his creative projects.
64 bits & Malachite offers a musical style based in these cross-fertilisations and collaborations, unbridled and freed from the labels of “genres”.
