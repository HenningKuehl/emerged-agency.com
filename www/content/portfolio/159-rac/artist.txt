Text: RAC used to stand for "Remix Artist Collective".

These days it's the solo project of André Allen Anjos.

RAC is primarily known for remixes (200+). Check them out here. It started with an ambitious goal to change the way things were remixed. Taking the focus away from danceability and attempting different and interesting arrangements. Some notable examples include: Lady Ga Ga, Bob Marley, Ella Fitzgerald, Kings Of Leon, Katy Perry, The Shins, Bloc Party, Chromeo, Lana Del Rey, Two Door Cinema Club and many many more.

RAC has been featured in ads for numerous corporations, including: Apple, Facebook, Google, Citibank, GoDaddy, Hulu, Uber, Delta, Shopstyle, etc.

In 2014, André released an album on Cherrytree / Interscope Records called "Strangers". It includes the singles "Let Go" ft. Kele (Bloc Party) and MNDR. "Hollywood" ft. Penguin Prison. "Cheap Sunglasses" ft. Matthew Koma.

In 2016, André was nominated for a GRAMMY in the category of Best Remixed Recording.

In 2017, André won the GRAMMY award in the category of Best Remixed Recording.

Sometimes for fun the husband&amp;wife combo, Liz and André record some covers. Check them out here.
