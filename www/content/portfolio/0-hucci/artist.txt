Text: UK Trap prodigy HUCCI has been generating serious heat since his 2013 debut 'Novacane' EP, garnering support from trap demigods like Flosstradamus and reaching across the pond to the ears of Diplo's Mad Decent.

In the Summer of 2014 'HITTA' broke hard on YouTube and his first smash racked up fans globally at phenomenal speed, setting up 2015 as his breakthrough year.

2015 has seen him play headline shows in Asia, Australia, Europe, USA and launch Veyron Arche, which has featured releases from HUCCI, Ozzie, Fwdslxsh &amp; The Ninetys so far.

Designed and centred around the mysterious UK producer, his aim for the label is to bring the next generation of new talent with him.
