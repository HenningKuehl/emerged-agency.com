Text:

Alice On The Roof is a young Belgian artist, who studied the piano in the United States for several years. In 2013, she returned to her home country and started to write her first songs. In late 2014, she finally gathered the courage to send her demos to producer Tim Bran (London Grammar, La Roux, KT Tunstall). He immediately fell for her unique, vulnerable voice, and offered to produce her debut album, which is set to be released at the end of this year. Alice On The Roof's music is a mix of impassioned piano pop and synthesiser music, and all of her songs are potential hits.
