The Geek x Vrv (TGXV) have had an explosive year and a half since being catapulted into the spotlight at the end of 2013 when they released their track “It’s Because”. Since then, TGXV have been busy splitting their time between touring in Europe and hitting the studio to craft tunes bearing their signature sound: a dynamic, sample-heavy blend of genres like funk, jazz, and soul with an electro-hip-hop twist. Within a few months, “It’s Because” hit 2 million plays and was featured on the French radio station ‘Radio Nova’, paving the way to open for electro-soul heavyweights such as Pretty Lights, Gramatik, and GRiZ, and allowing them to perform at festivals including ‘Foreztival’, and ‘Positiv Festival’.
Their live show is bursting at the seams with raw, unadulterated energy that they bring to the stage with their live-production APC and Maschine setup. TGXV have had several popular remixes of artists including Stevie Wonder, Kill Paris, Jabberwocky, 20syl, and Flume, and most recently won the famed remix contest for Odesza’s “Say My Name”. They have seen support from big-name artists including Pretty Lights, Odesza, Kygo, Gramatik, 20Syl and GRiZ, who released their EP “Electric City” on his label ‘All Good Records’ earlier this year.
Keep a close eye on this dynamic duo over the coming months.
