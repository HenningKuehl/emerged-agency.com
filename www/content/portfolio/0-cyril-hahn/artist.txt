The best music is made by those who expose our very guilty pleasures with undeniable, stimulating creations. This can be said of the mere samples we have received this year from rising producer CYRIL HAHN.

The Bern, Switzerland native experimented early on with music production during high school and abandoned it after leaving his hometown to pursue post- secondary in Vancouver, Canada. After a 3 year hiatus from music, feeling a need to return to his former love, he sat down and did what is considered by some to be taboo: stripped down two iconic R&amp;B songs and gave them his unique atmospheric twist: Mariah Carey’s “TOUCH MY BODY” and Destiny’s Child “SAY MY NAME.”

Cyrils’ re-works have hit a significant nerve with fans &amp; other artists. In the Summer of 2012, SAY MY NAME hit #1 on HYPEM in under 2 weeks and to date has over 3 million plays on Soundcloud, countless tribute videos with over 5 million YouTube views. Other crowd favourites include his take on Solange’s LOSING YOU, a viby, upbeat refix of labelmate Jessie Ware SWEET TALK and recently tapped by the Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Ros for his take on their single RAFSTRAUMUR.

This fall Cyril released his debut single PERFECT FORM on his home label PMR Records, which instantly became one of this summers’ anthems. Look out for more shows and releases, feeding your guilty pleasures for years to come.
