Martin Jensen has become one of Danish music’s greatest viral success stories with more than 2 million likes on his Facebook page and a staggering 400 million views on his videos so far!

He appeared out of nowhere in the beginning of 2015 when he released the bounce hit ’Sí’ inspired by Cristiano Ronaldo’s shout of joy at the Ballon D’or awards. The video, wherein he shows how the hook was created spread like wildfire, so Martin and his label disco:wax decided to produce the full-length version.

Since then the Danish DJ has become a viral phenomenon with his creative and participatory approach to dance music production. He has created more than 35 videos each teasing for a new likeable hook. The idea is to always involve his audience in the creative process of the music, and let them become a part of the decision-making, when choosing a new song to release.

Today Martin Jensen has released three tracks, where two of those originates from videos he has shared on the social media. His latest single ‘Miracles’ is built upon the sound of a screaming plastic duck sampled in Martin’s video ‘Tropical Duck Army’. The teaser-video has exceeded 30 million views and the full-length song, which vocals is delivered by Danish Bjørnskov, has reached over 19 million plays on Spotify. Martin’s debut and breakthrough single ‘Sí’ gained a 1st place at Global Viral Top 50 on Spotify when it was released and today the song has streamed more than 20 million times.

Martin’s latest single ‘All I Wanna Do’ was released on April 8th 2016 and in no time it has exceeded 30 million streams. Stay tuned and watch the next global superstar story in the making unfold.
