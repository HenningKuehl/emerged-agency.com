Over the past year, Chicago’s breakout trio KREWELLA (sisters/vocalists/lyricists Jahan and Yasmine Yousaf) have been enamoring radio listeners and dance floor enthusiasts across the country with their gold-certified, Top 10 hit “Alive” and club staple “Killing It” from their Play Hard  EP. These songs, plus their most recent single, the Top 40 track “Live For The Night” --along with “Come And Get It” and “Dancing With the Devil” featuring Fall Out Boy’s Patrick Stump and Travis Barker of Blink 182--will also appear on GET WET.
