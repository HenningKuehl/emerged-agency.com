Title: Wiki

Text: "The sooty atmosphere, the complex rhyme structure, the tactile combination of claustrophobia and swagger: New York rap is a religion in decline.
That makes Wiki's devoted practice of it all the more striking. The main rapper in Ratking, he's pure texture: His voice is raspy and nasal, and he clusters his syllables tight, as if huddling under a large coat in cold weather." -Â The New York Times
