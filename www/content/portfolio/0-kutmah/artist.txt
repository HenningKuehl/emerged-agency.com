Kutmah (pronounced koot/mah) will release his long overdue debut album “The Revenge Of Black Belly Button!” (or TROBBB!) via Big Dada on 11th August 2017. The record features an incredible cast of guests - Gonjasufi, Jonwayne, Natureboy Flako, Ta’Raach, Jeremiah Jae, Zeroh, Zackey Force Funk, N8NOFACE, Sach, Akello G Light and DJ Chris P Cuts - spanning experimental meditative, Zennist loops; crackly oddball beats and abstract raps; as far as outright punk/noise and even folk/blues.

Heralded by Flying Lotus  as “one of the most influential DJs of the beat movement”, Kutmah’s skills and vision as a producer are brought to the fore on “TROBBB!” which is an incredibly sentimental record, heavily referential to his past but also future-facing, and not just in its sonics. “I wanted to make a record for loners, “ he laughs. “You know some records have that ‘Hey! I'm at a festival!’ sound? Well I wanted to do the opposite of that.” 

It’s fitting that the album arrives via Big Dada - a label that helped shape his vision. “Big Dada started the same year I started DJing. Not DJing in clubs or making tapes. Literally when I first touched turntables,” he explains. “I knew I had to find that other type of music to fit where my head was at. Leftfield beats and abstract rhymes were what I was looking for and alongside Jazz Fudge, Mo Wax, Asphodel and Fondle ‘Em, Big Dada was what I was digging.”
