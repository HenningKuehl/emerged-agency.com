Title: Rezz
----
Text: REZZ is a DJ/Producer based out of Niagara Falls, Canada. At only 20 years old, her unique spin on underground Techno has caught the ears of Deadmau5 &amp; Skrillex, and made her a hot topic on music blogs &amp; publications around the world often hailing her as “Girlsaffelstein”. Having built a following through a series of free releases on SoundCloud, REZZ’s debut label release ’Serenity' came out June 2015 by request of Mau5trap records boss Deadmau5. Her penchant for dark, eerie atmospheric tracks that exhibit maturity far beyond her young age is what caught the ear of Skrillex and led to her follow up 3 track ‘Insurrection EP’ on his NEST imprint. REZZ's ever-evolving and idiosyncratic electro sound is only getting bigger as proven with her most recent EP release on Mau5trap ‘The Silence is Deafening’.

After joining the roster at AM Only, REZZ has secured herself a spot on major festivals including Tomorrowland, HARD Day of the Dead, Something Wicked, Sunset Music Festival, Ever After, Mysteryland, and HolyShip! among others. Her sound is as unique as her live show experience, where she is gaining a cult like following with every passing show. Having already garnered so much attention so quickly, the stage is set for REZZ to explode around the world.
