Text:

Jungle are based around a core musical duo of the lifelong friends Josh Lloyd-Watson and Tom McFarland, known simply as ‘J’ and ‘T’, who expand to a thrilling seven piece live, and make mesmeric, kaleidoscopic modern soul that’s unmistakably born in the UK but has true global appeal. Their debut album, which gained them worldwide attention, was recorded between the band’s own home studio in Shepherds Bush, London and the XL Recordings studio in nearby Ladbroke Grove.
