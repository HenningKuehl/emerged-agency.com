Title: Falcons
----
Text: FALCONS is a producer from Los Angeles, California. FALCONS is an amalgamation of many things, a boiling pot of styles and genre-free influence. The tastes range from world music to southern rap, and everything in between.
With three remix volumes, a Boiler Room set under his belt, and support from some of the industries biggest taste makers, there seems to be no stopping this young producer. The only rules are to push the boundaries of conventional r&amp;b, rap, and electronic music, exploring new directions, but never losing site of theÂ dancefloor.
