Text: The Glitch Mob – the Los Angeles-based trio comprising Justin Boreta, Ed Ma, and Joshua Mayer – continues their forward movement into 2014. Boreta, edit, and Ooah came together around 2006, passing through various members until settling on this core trio of musicians. Together, they combined their different skills and aesthetics into the compellingly collaged whole that has become one of the most beloved live electronic acts, and distinctive recording artists, working today. The trio released their sophomore album, Love Death Immortality, in February 2014 followed by an international tour schedule including appearances at Coachella, Bonnaroo, Ultra, and EDC.
