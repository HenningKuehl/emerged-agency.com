Title: Odd Beholder
----
Text: The warmth of a mammal. The sound of the sea. A boy's smile. When you truly behold something you become it, and when this happens, you disappear. Serenity. Patches of noise. The roaring sound of blood rushing through the veins. Introverts attracted by the limelight. 
He rushes forward instinctively. She cultivates notes like bacteria in a petri- dish. It's all research. Hesitation. Things left unsaid. Thinking so much that it leads to paralysis. Chaos. Shifting perspectives. Writing songs to preserve delicate emotions during rough times. 
Rain. Electricity. Sound as texture. Collecting sounds. Synthesizers and drum machines. Ways to escape a busy mind and keep fear at bay. Luckily poetry is a code and you can say the most dangerous things out loud without actually saying them. 

The "Lighting" EP was written in Amsterdam and recorded in Berlin. 

Odd Beholder are Daniela Weinmann (vocals, guitar, composition) and James Varghese (production, e-bass, synths). The group was founded in a bomb shelter in Zurich, Switzerland.
