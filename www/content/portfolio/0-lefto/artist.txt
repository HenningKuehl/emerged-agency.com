Title: Lefto
----
Text: “You can’t sleep on Lefto! He’s always on it…” – Gilles Peterson (BBC 6 Music, Brownswood)

Described by Fact! Magazine as “your favourite DJ’s favourite DJ” and voted best DJ in the Red Bull Belgium DJ Top 100 Category multiple times, Lefto has proven to be one of the most important tastemakers Europe has to offer.  This bearded early riser is consistently a couple steps ahead of your average early adopter with affiliations to labels such as Brownswood Recordings, Blue Note, and !K7 Records.

World renowned, Lefto regularly blesses sound systems around the globe.  His travels have resulted in several compilations on notable labels including a collaboration with DJ Simbad on Gilles Peterson’s Brownswood Recordings, a compilation for Universal Music, a couple of releases in collaboration with Los Angeles based label 101 Apparel, and his latest compilation for BBE/Southport Weekender.  He released his beat LP on Record Store Day and has 3 compilations coming for Universal Music along with his 101 Apparel follow up with LA DJ/Producer J.Rocc.  Karavan is 2017’s major vinyl release with LA producer Free The Robots for LA based label New Los Angeles, a collaboration album of beats inspired by their trips around the globe.  As well as a record for Serato containing exclusive tracks from Badbadnotgood, Henry Wu, Mono/Poly, The Gaslamp Killer and many more.

Spring 2017 marks the airing of LEFTO IN TRANSIT, a 6 episode documentary series produced by Canvas TV featuring Lefto as he visits the underground music scenes of Los Angeles, Chicago, Brussels, London, Seoul, and greater Belgium.
