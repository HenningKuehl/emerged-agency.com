Two Fresh has travelled a long way with their sound in a short time.
Originally from Nashville, TN, and now residing in Denver CO, twin brothers Sherwyn & Kendrick Nicholls have developed into a unique electronic production team.

The twins early work, 'The Baker's Dozen', was nostalgic of early 90's hip-hop, using soulful and lo-fi samples, intertwined with classic drum stylings. With their first full length album, 'Airmail', Two Fresh took the sound in a spacey, yet grounded direction that has set the foundation for their more recent works. Having released 'Watch This!' in early 2013, the twins' latest EP showcases the more upbeat side of their musical spectrum.

Sherwyn and Kendrick developed a broad fan base, spanning all across North America, through extensive touring with artists such as Skrillex, Bassnectar, 12th Planet, and Daedelus as well as performing at a slew of music festivals including Electric Daisy Carnival, SXSW and Detroit Electronic Music Festival.

Now in their fifth year as a group, be sure to catch Two Fresh out this summer performing new material from their forthcoming full-length release due this fall!
