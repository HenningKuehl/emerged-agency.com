Text:

Ibeyi are 20 years old French Cuban twins, Naomi and Lisa-Kainde Diaz. They are daughters of the late Cuban percussionist Angà Diaz. Naomi plays percussive instruments, the Cajon and the Batas, while Lisa-Kainde plays piano. Together the twins sing and combine modern pop, hip-hop and electronic influences with the traditional sounds of their father’s Yoruba culture.

Ibeyi, their debut album, will be released via XL Recordings on 16th February (17th in US).
