Hailing from the sandstone bedrock that is Sydney, this duo is the fresh face Australia’s beloved ‘Sweat it Out’ &amp; voice of the ADD generation.
Released in Mid November 2011, their debut 4 track EP ‘7 Dollar Bill’ caused quite a stir;
Switch, Bag Raiders, Sinden, Boys Noize &amp; countless others, all on board for this new sound.
2012 has seen an onslaught of epic remix’s from the pair. Most notably their mix of Major Lazer’s ‘Get Free’.
Gaining the attention of Tiga, Flosstradamus, Nero &amp; Diplo himself, their future bass rework, scored them official 12″ Vinyl release on Mad Decent/Downtown.
With the who’s who of EDM dropping their tunes on BBC Radio 1 &amp; every major festival around the globe, don’t be surprised if you see the WSN boys jet setting across the globe in the coming months.
Currently touring Aus/New Zealand, an official remix on the way for Mark Foster, Kimbra &amp; A-Trak &amp; their 2nd EP approaching completion, the ball is well and truly in motion for Australia’s next big export.
